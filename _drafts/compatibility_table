## Compatibility table

We group the drop-in application releases into logical "suite versions" and adhere to regular release windows, roughly 1x/month.
We can release on demand if needed as well.

<OptionsTable
  options={[
    ['Suite Version', 'Released', 'Adobe Commerce', 'Storefront compatibility package', 'Drop-in SDK', 'Drop-in versions'],
    ['1.0.0', 'December 2024', '2.4.7', '4.7.0', '0.37.0',
      '- Cart 1.0.0,
      - PDP 1.0.0,
      - Checkout 1.0.0,
      - User Auth 1.0.0,
      - User Account 1.0.0,
      - Orders 1.0.0'
    ],
  ]}
