Full-featured shopping components that turn websites into storefronts. They are not the primitive components, like the Carousels and Galleries used within them. For example, our product details page, checkout, and cart drop-in components are featured as full pages out of the box to create the entire storefront shopping experience for a website. Our drop-in components can also support different layouts for different purposes. For example, our mini-cart is simply a cart with compact layout typical of mini-carts so that they can be added to Popover or Panel components.

For the purpose of describing slots, you can think of a drop-in component as a special lego brick with a studded surface on all six sides. Each side of our brick provides a surface (slot) to attach additional bricks (UI components, functions) that extend our special brick (drop-in) in multiple directions. Like the sides of our lego brick, a drop-in component provides multiple slots to make it easy for developers to “snap-on” their own UI components and functions to extend our drop-in components to meet a multitude of specific needs.
