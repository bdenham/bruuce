     - **Teaser 1:**

       - **Content:** “It's expected to rain today on your way to work, don't forget your umbrella”

     - **Teaser 2:**  
       - **Header:** “Your best fitness pal”

       - **Image:** Pick an image from the AEM Assets library.

       - **No header**  
       - **Content:** “Students save with City Signal more”

   Your product template uses a 2x2 layout. To change it:
     - Go to the `<section-metadata>` block.
     - Change the style from `grid-row` to `grid-column`.
   
   In the preview, the teasers will reflow to a 1x3 layout if three are in the section.
