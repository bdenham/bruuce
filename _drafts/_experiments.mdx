<Callouts>

1. **Experiment**: A test that compares two or more variants of a drop-in component to determine which variant performs better.
1. **Variant**: A version of a drop-in component that is different from the original version. Variants are created to test different features, designs, or content.
1. **Control**: The original version of the drop-in component that is used as a baseline for comparison.
1. **Challenger**: The variant of the drop-in component being tested.

## Track performance

After launching the experiment, you need to track the performance of each variant to determine which one performs better. Use analytics tools to monitor the KPIs and analyze the results. Based on the data, you can decide whether to implement the changes permanently or revert to the original version.

## Best practices

When creating A/B experiments for drop-in components, consider the following best practices:

- **Start small**: Test one variable at a time to isolate the impact of each change.
- **Use statistical significance**: Ensure that the sample size is large enough to draw valid conclusions.
- **Monitor continuously**: Track the performance of each variant throughout the experiment.
- **Iterate**: Use the results of the experiment to inform future tests and optimizations.
