This is an example of a reusable content fragment that can be included in multiple pages throughout the site.

Key benefits of this approach:

- **Single source of truth** - Update content in one place
- **Consistency** - Same formatting and messaging everywhere
- **Easy maintenance** - No need to hunt down duplicated content
- **Markdown friendly** - Non-developers can easily edit content

Simply import this fragment into any MDX page where you need this information.
