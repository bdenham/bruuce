excerpt: "The utterly non-linear journey of a person who somehow went from documenting oil drilling APIs to being nominated for Adobe awards. Featuring: questionable career choices, accidental expertise, and why good documentation is basically magic."

## The Confession of a Career Zigzagger

Let me start with a truth that would make any career counselor weep: I have absolutely no idea how I ended up where I am.

Thirty-four years ago, I thought I'd begin work on my PhD in Sociology, graduate, then either teach or do research for a think tank, the corporate sector, or the government.

Fast forward to today: Adobe nominates me for awards while I manage documentation ecosystems serving hundreds of developers worldwide. 

The unexpected part? Apparently, after three decades watching developers struggle with bad docs, you eventually start building better ones yourself.

## Chapter 1: The Oil Fields (Or: How I Learned Documentation is Universal)

My journey began at the Texas Comptroller's Office, documenting accounting systems. But it made a sharp turn when I joined Schlumberger, writing API documentation for oil & gas systems. Imagine the scenario: Engineers from different countries, speaking different languages, all trying to make expensive drilling equipment not explode.

No pressure, right?

The oil fields taught me something fundamental: **Good documentation transcends language barriers.** When your words might be the difference between a successful drill and a very expensive mistake, you get really good at clarity. Fast.

This skill transfers to everything else in tech.

## Chapter 2: The Plot Thickens (2006-2018: Visual Designer Meets Full-Stack Reality)

At TOPAZ Technologies, I thought I'd be writing documentation and doing visual design work as the marketing department's first designer.

Instead, I ended up:
- Designing all product user interfaces and experiences
- Leading AngularJS application overhauls—someone had to
- Training entire dev teams on how to use Angular Material—turns out good design systems don't explain themselves
- Becoming a "Creative Director" (still not sure I earned that title)

**The revelation:** The gap between technical capability and user needs isn't just a gap—it's a canyon. Somehow, I'd become the person with the bridge-building equipment.

## Chapter 3: Adobe and the Art of Scale (2018-Present)

Adobe happened, bringing a whole new level of complexity. Suddenly, I wasn't just writing docs—I was architecting entire developer experience ecosystems.

What that means:
- **Managing documentation systems** hundreds of developers depend on daily
- **Building interactive React applications** to demonstrate APIs—static examples are for amateurs
- **Creating CLI tools** that make developers' lives easier
- **Earning Adobe Founders Award and Extreme Ownership Award nominations** (still pinching myself)

The scale is bonkers, but the mission remains the same: turn confusion into confidence.

## My Core Philosophy

**The best developer documentation doesn't just inform—it transforms.**

Those magical moments when a developer goes from "What the hell?" to "Oh, that makes perfect sense!" aren't accidents. They're carefully crafted experiences built on empathy, clarity, and—let's be honest—lots of trial and error.

## The Real Philosophy: I Don't Just Write About It

My dirty secret: I build the tools I write about. I code the interfaces I document. I create the CLI commands I explain.

Why? You can't truly explain something you don't understand from the inside. When I write about reducing friction, it's because I've felt that friction myself—then built something to smooth it out.

This blog is where I spill those secrets and reflect on what I've learned about:

- **Interactive documentation systems** developers actually enjoy using
- **CLI development** that turns tedious tasks into one-liners
- **Search implementations** with Algolia that find what you need before you finish typing
- **Information architecture** using frameworks like Diátaxis (cooler than it sounds)
- **Visual communication** through animations that explain better than words
- **Community building** without corporate buzzword fluff

## What's Coming Next

Coming up:
- **War stories** from presenting at Meet Magento Indonesia (featuring jet lag and cultural discoveries)
- **Behind-the-scenes chaos** from collaborating with cross-functional teams at Adobe
- **Real insights** from deep involvement in the Magento open-source community
- **Honest takes** on what works (and what spectacularly doesn't)

## The Invitation

This isn't just a blog—it's a conversation starter. The best developer experiences are built through shared learning, collective wisdom, and the occasional friendly argument about documentation structure.

**Got a developer experience horror story, a documentation win that saved your sanity, or a question that's been bugging you?**

Let's talk about it. After all, we're all trying to make complex things make sense—and that's more fun when we do it together.
