After 30+ years at the intersection of technical writing, developer experience, and visual communication, I'm excited to launch this space where I can share insights from my journey across three fascinating decades of helping developers succeed.

## From Oil Fields to Creative Software

My career has been anything but linear. I started at Schlumberger, writing API documentation for oil & gas systems used by engineers across multiple countries. There, I learned that truly effective documentation transcends language barriers—it communicates through clarity, structure, and empathy.

From 2006 to 2018 at TOPAZ Technologies, I evolved from visual designer to full-stack product strategist, leading AngularJS application overhauls and training development teams on Angular Material best practices. This taught me the critical importance of bridging the gap between technical capability and user needs.

Since 2018 at Adobe, I've been leading developer experience initiatives that serve thousands of developers worldwide. I manage the Adobe Commerce documentation ecosystem, build interactive React applications for API demonstrations, and develop CLI tools that streamline workflows. I've been nominated for both the Adobe Founders Award and Extreme Ownership Award for my work.

## What I've Learned About Developer Experience

Through all these experiences, I've discovered that the best developer documentation doesn't just inform—it transforms. It creates those precious "aha" moments that turn confusion into confidence, complexity into clarity, and hesitation into action.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I'll share insights from my work with:

- **Interactive documentation systems** using React and advanced Storybook customizations
- **CLI development** that boosts developer productivity
- **Custom search implementations** with Algolia for better content discovery
- **Information architecture** using frameworks like Diátaxis
- **Visual communication** through infographics, animations, and video content
- **Community building** and developer advocacy experiences

## My Philosophy: I Don't Just Write the Docs

I build tools, craft interfaces, and create explanations that click. Understanding how things work from the inside makes all the difference in explaining them clearly. Whether I'm developing a CLI tool to automate repetitive tasks or creating interactive API playgrounds, my goal is always the same: reduce friction and help developers get from question to solution as smoothly as possible.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to share stories from presenting at Meet Magento Indonesia, lessons learned from collaborating with cross-functional teams at Adobe, and insights from my deep involvement with the Magento open-source community.

Most importantly, I want this to be a conversation. The best developer experiences are built through shared learning and collaboration.

Thanks for joining me on this journey—let's build better developer experiences together!
