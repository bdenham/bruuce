Adobe Commerce uses a [hierarchical structure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/start/setup/websites-stores-views) to manage multiple stores within a single instance. This structure consists of three levels: websites, stores, and store views. Localization is managed at the store view level, allowing merchants to present the store in different languages and apply the proper currency.

To maintain storefronts that implement Edge Delivery Services, you must be familiar with its building blocks. The following topics describe the EDS features.

* [Authoring and Publishing Content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/document-authoring/authoring)
* [Bulk Metadata](https://www.aem.live/docs/bulk-metadata)
* [Placeholders](https://www.aem.live/docs/placeholders)

## Big Picture

Multi-store refers to a streamlined architecture that enables managing multiple stores with unique catalogs and localization while leveraging a shared code base and unified content delivery. The content hierarchy follows [Edge Delivery Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview) best practices, emphasizing a single-tier structure.

Content is organized primarily by language, enabling global reuse and minimizing duplication. US English files should be placed in the `en` directory of the project root. All other language- and region-specific files should be placed in a directory that is named in the format `*region-code_language-code*`. For example, the `/en/` directory contains data for the US market, while the  `/en_ca/` directory contains data for Canada. French content should be placed in directories with names like `fr_fr` for France and `fr_ca` for Canada.

The Sharepoint file structure of a multi-store is shown below. Remove the `.docx` and `.xlsx` extensions for Google Drive files.

<FileTree>
- **en/** _-- English store (Default root language)_
  - configs.xls _-- Defines API endpoints, headers, and other environment-specific data._
  - placeholders.xlsx _-- Stores reusable tokens for text and UI components._
  - index.docx _-- The home page of the English US store._
- **en_ca/** _-- English Canadian Store_
  - configs.xls _-- Environment specific data for the English Canadian Store_
  - placeholders_overrides.xlsx _-- Entries that override the English store._
  - index.docx _-- The home page of the English Canadian store._
- fstab.yaml _-- Sets mountpoints and folder mappings._
- metadata.xlsx _-- URL, root path, and placeholder mappings for multi-store_
- store-switcher.docx _-- Manages the list of stores and their URL to render in the UI_
</FileTree>

Default files are provided in the example content. These files can be customized to suit your needs.

## Global files

These files reside in the root of the project and are shared across all stores.

### Metadata

Metadata entries are managed as bulk (https://www.aem.live/docs/bulk-metadata) in `metadata.xlsx`.
This file overrides Commerce endpoint config files and placeholders based on the `root` page metadata provided. Otherwise, it defaults to the base `/`.

From the root of your project, create a `metadata.xlsx` file with contents similar to the following:

| URL | Root | Placeholders |
|---|---|---|
| /en/** | /en/ | /en/placeholders.json |
| /en_ca/** | /en_ca/ | /en/placeholders.json<br/>/en_ca/placeholders-overrides.json |

The URL value defines the path to the store view. The root value specifies the directory where the `configs.xlsx` files are located. The placeholders value specifies the `placeholders.json` file to use. Adding a new line with another path in this value specifies an override file. Both files will be fetched, and the values in the second file will override those in the first.

### Store Switcher

The `store-switcher.docx` file manages the list of stores that are displayed in a store switcher element.
This file contains a bulleted list that can be nested. Each line must define the display name of your store with an active link to the store.

### Folder mapping

Add folder mapping to the product detail pages (PDP) in the `fstab.yaml` file of the project. This is the only code change required and must be merged into the `main` branch to take effect.

From the root of your project, create a `fstab.yaml` file.

```yaml
export const exampleCode = `mountpoints:
  /: https://example.mountpoint.com/:f:/r/sites/myproject

folders:
  /products/: /products/default
  /en/products/: /en/products/default
  /en_ca/products/: /en_ca/products/default`;
export const fileName = 'fstab.yaml';
export const highlights = ['file', 'CMS'];

<Code code={exampleCode} lang="yaml" title={fileName} mark={highlights} />
```

## Store-specific files

The content, configuration, and placeholder files help define the experience in each store view.

### Content files

The content files provide the structure of the pages that are served to your shoppers. are located in the store view directories and contain the content for each store view. These files are typically in the form of `.docx` files and are used to generate the store view pages.

### Configuration files

Each store view has its own set of configuration files. The `configs.xlsx` file defines the API endpoints, headers, and other environment-specific data for your production environment. The `configs-stage.xlsx` and `configs-dev.xlsx` files are used for staging and development environments, respectively.

### Placeholders

The `placeholders.xlsx` file stores reusable tokens for text and UI components. This file is used to define the text that is displayed on your storefront. The `placeholders.json` file is generated from this file and is used to replace the tokens in your content files. You can optionally create a `placeholders-overrides.json` file that define text that supersedes the values defined in the `en` store view.

## Step-by-Step

This example adds a new English Canadian store view (`en_ca`) that is similar to the default English store (`en`).

<Tasks>

<Task>
### Add a new store

Create an `en_ca` store view in the Commerce Admin and perform the following steps in your project.

1. Create the `en_ca` folder under the project root in Sharepoint or Google Docs.

1. Copy the configuration files, placeholders file, and document pages from the `en` directory to the `en_ca` directory.

</Task>

<Task>
### Update Content Files

Next, localize or translate the files in your project.

1. Translate or localize content files in the `/en_ca/` folders.

1. Ensure all labels in `placeholders.xlsx` are accurately translated into the desired language.

</Task>

<Task>
### Update environment configurations

Modify the three configuration files to include appropriate Commerce API endpoints and headers, such as the store view.

</Task>

<Task>
### Set metadata to the chosen market's path

Create a metadata file and configure settings for the new store view.

1. Create a `metadata.xlsx` file in the root of your project.

1. Set the **root** values to the directory where `configs.xlsx` files are located. The default is `/`.

1. Set the **placeholders** to the `placeholders.json` file to use. The default is `/placeholders.json`.

1. (Optional) Create a `placeholders_overrides.json` file if you have overrides that apply to the Canadian store.

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `Cart.Cart.heading` | `Shopping Cart ({count})` |
   | `Cart.Cart.editCart` | `Edit` |

</Task>

<Task>
### Map folders

Update the `fstab.yaml` file of the project to  add folder mapping to the PDP page.

:::note[Code Change Required]
This is the only code change required and must be merged into the `main` branch to take effect.

</Task>

<Task>
### Preview and validate

Finally, preview and publish the new store view.

1. Preview the updated folder `/en_ca/` with [AEM Sidekick](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/resources/sidekick/sidekick).

1. Validate the storefront experience by accessing the new language/region and testing the rendering, navigation, and data accuracy.

1. Update the `store-switcher.docx` file to include the new store view.

1. Publish the updated folder with the AEM Sidekick folder when ready.
