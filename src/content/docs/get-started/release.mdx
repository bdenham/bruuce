import Aside from '@components/Aside.astro';

Adobe organizes storefront application releases into logical suite versions and follows a regular release schedule (approximately once a month). However, Adobe may release updates more frequently to deliver new features or address critical issues. 

## Compatibility table

The following table shows the compatibility between all of the storefront release items by suite version:

| Release item | Version | |
|---|---|---|
| **Storefront suite** | 1.0.0 |
| **Released** | December 2024 |
| **Adobe Commerce** | 2.4.7 |
| **Storefront compatibility package** | 4.7.0 |
| **Drop-in SDK** | Tools: 0.38.0<br/>Build tools: 0.1.1 |
| **Drop-in components** | Product Details: 1.0.0<br/>Cart: 1.0.1<br/>Checkout: 1.0.0<br/>User Auth: 1.0.0<br/>User Account: 1.0.0<br/>Orders: 1.0.0 |

## Code changes

Every release includes changes to one or more codebases described in the [compatibility table](/get-started/release/#compatibility-table). The scope of the change determines whether the MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH number increases in the application's version according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes  
> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner  
> PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes  

<Aside type="note">
The "Storefront suite" version is used for marketing purposes and does not conform to semantic versioning.

### Public API

To determine when we increment the MAJOR version we must define a public API. The public API for drop-in components includes the following:

#### Integration APIs

Integration APIs are functions that are exposed to the storefront application to integrate the drop-in components. These functions are defined in the drop-in SDK and are used by the drop-in components.

| File | Function Signatures |
|---|---|
| `@dropins/tools/fetch-graphql.js` | `setEndpoint`<br/>`setFetchGraphQlHeader`<br/>`removeFetchGraphQlHeader`<br/>`setFetchGraphQlHeaders`<br/>`fetchGraphQl`<br/>`getConfig` |
| `@dropins/tools/event-bus.js` | `on`<br/>`emit`<br/>`lastPayload` |
| `@dropins/tools/initializer.js` | `mountImmediately` |
| `@dropins/tools/lib.js` | `debounce`<br/>`getFormValues`<br/>`getFormErrors`<br/>`classes`<br/>`deepmerge`<br/>`merge`<br/>`generateSrcset` |

#### Slots

Slots are built-in extension points in the drop-in components to add your own UI components and functions. The following table lists the default properties and individual drop-in slots that are available:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Default properties available to all slots: | |
| | Function signatures of the following functions:<br/>`prependSibling`<br/>`prependChild`<br/>`replaceWith`<br/>`appendChild`<br/>`appendSibling`<br/>`getSlotElement`<br/>`onChange` |
| | Structure of the [`dictionary`](/dropins/all/labeling/#drop-in-component-dictionaries) object |
| Individual drop-in slots | Function signatures as defined elsewhere on this site (for example, [cart slots](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/dropins/cart/slots/)) |

#### Drop-in design tokens

Drop-in [design tokens](/dropins/all/branding/#design-tokens) are defined in the drop-in SDK and are used by the drop-in components to style the storefront application.
