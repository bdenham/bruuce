Welcome to your Commerce Storefront journey. Our goal is to make the journey fun and informative. We start every topic with big-picture overviews and relevant vocabulary. We then walk you through the details step-by-step. And finally, we provide a sandbox for practice when possible. Let's get started.

## Big picture

The tutorial helps you quickly create a new Edge Delivery Services storefront using the [Commerce boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce). The boilerplate provides a starter storefront that uses a pre-configured Adobe Commerce environment.

After completing this tutorial, you will have a new GitHub repository with a storefront that is pre-configured with all the necessary components and services to get you started. You will also have a local development environment where you can explore the boilerplate and start customizing it to develop your own production storefront.

The following diagram shows the steps you'll take to create and configure your starter storefront:

</Diagram>

The full details are slightly more involved. Let's break it down.

</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. **Create a code repo** by generating a storefront repository from the [boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce).
1. **Connect your site to your content** using the `mountpoint` URL in the **`fstab.yaml`** in your GitHub repo or onboarding to [AEM's Config Service](https://www.aem.live/docs/config-service-setup) and modifying your `folders` and `content` pointers. You can use [default-fstab.yaml](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/blob/main/default-fstab.yaml) or [default-site.json](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/blob/main/default-site.json) as a reference.
1. **Add the Code Sync app** to your newly created repo. This app automatically redeploys your storefront when you push changes to the main branch. It also provides the Edge Delivery system (Helix Admin) with access to your repo so it can coordinate code changes with content changes.
1. **Create a content folder** in https://da.live/ using the [import tool](https://da.live/app/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/tools/site-creator/site-creator) or the [site importer](https://da.live/apps/import), if you already have a site in SharePoint or Google Drive.
1. **Connect your site to your data** using the values in the **`config.json`** in your GitHub repo or onboarding to [AEM's Config Service](https://www.aem.live/docs/config-service-setup) and modifying your "public config". You can use [demo-config.json](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/blob/main/demo-config.json) as a reference.
1. **Install and configure Sidekick** so it can preview, publish, and edit content on your storefront.
1. **Set up your local development environment** and install the dependencies. Start the development server and explore your new storefront.

## Vocabulary

Before we dive into the step-by-step guide, let's review some key Vocabulary that will help you understand the process of creating and configuring your storefront.

<Vocabulary>

### Boilerplate template

The boilerplate template is a pre-configured storefront that includes all the necessary components and services to get you started. It's a great way to quickly create a new storefront with all the necessary components and services already in place.

### Code Sync app

The Code Sync app listens to changes in your code repositories (commits and merges to the `main` branch) and publishes code to the Edge Delivery code bus. It also intelligently purges CDN caches when changes have been made. This app is essential for keeping your storefront up-to-date with the latest changes.

### Content folder

The content folder is where you store all the content for your storefront. This includes images, text, and other assets that make up your site. By sharing read/write access to your content folder with Edge Delivery Services, you enable it to provide all the features of document-based authoring, such as editing, previewing, and publishing.

### Sidekick

Sidekick is an extension that makes it easy for creators to connect, edit, preview, and publish content directly from documents and spreadsheets in your content folder. It's also responsible for pushing content to the Edge Delivery content bus so it can be previewed and published.

### content mountpoint

The `content mountpoint` is a pointer to your content folder on https://da.live, Google Drive, or SharePoint. The content mountpoint can be defined either by specifying the `mountpoint` in the **`fstab.yaml`** file on the `main` branch of your remote GitHub repo, or by defining `content` source in your site config if you are using the Config Service.

</Vocabulary>

## Example

Our CitiSignal demo site was built from the same boilerplate you will set up to develop your own storefront. You can access the full demo site here: https://main--citisignal-one--adobedevxsc.aem.live/.

<Embed src="https://main--citisignal-one--adobedevxsc.aem.live" height="520" />

## Step-by-step

The centerpiece of this **20-minute storefront** is our Commerce boilerplate template. It provides a starter storefront that is pre-configured with our Commerce components and services and pre-connected to our Commerce boilerplate backend.

### Create code repository

This task requires you to have a GitHub account with access to the organization or owner where you want to create your new repo.

<Diagram caption="Create your storefront repo.">
  ![Create your storefront repo](images/create-repo.webp)
</Diagram>

:::note[Sign into GitHub]
Make sure you are signed into your GitHub account before you start. Otherwise, you will not see the **Use this template** button.
:::

<Callouts columnCount="1">

1. Navigate to <Link href="https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce" text="aem-boilerplate-commerce" />, select the **Use this template** button, then select the **Create a new repository** option to open the form.
1. Complete the form with the following details:

   - **Repository template**: `hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce` (default).
   - **Include all branches**: Do not include all branches (default).
   - **Owner**: Your organization or account (required).

### Configure your Site

Edge Delivery Services requires configuration about your site to know what to render. These include at minimum a content reference and a code reference. The simplest approach is to create those references with `fstab.yaml` but you can onboard to Config Service and define the references there if you like.

<Callouts>
1. Rename [default-fstab.yaml](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/blob/main/default-fstab.yaml) to `fstab.yaml`.
1. Replace `{org}` and `{site}` in `fstab.yaml` using the GitHub url to determine the correct values: `https://github.com/{org}/{site}`.
1. Commit and push this change to the `main` branch of your repository.
</Callouts>
<Aside type="note" title="Config Service Approach">
  You can onboard instead by using the Config Service via the [Helix Admin API](https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html). To do this, please follow the steps in the [boilerplate readme](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce?tab=readme-ov-file#initial-setup).
</Aside>

### Add Code Sync GitHub app

The Code Sync app redeploys your storefront site whenever you push or merge changes to the `main` branch of your repo.

<Diagram caption="Add AEM Code Sync to your repository.">
  ![Add AEM Code Sync to your repository.](images/code-sync.webp)
</Diagram>

<Aside type="note" title="Slightly different UIs">
  A gray background on an organization or account indicates that at least one repository within it
  has the Code Sync app installed. In such cases, you are redirected to your organization's or
  account's **Code Sync configuration page**. There are no differences in the steps, but the UI
  differs slightly from the one shown in the diagram (**Install** vs **Save** buttons), which shows
  the Code Sync page for new installations.
</Aside>

<Callouts>

1. Navigate to the <Link text="AEM Code Sync app" href="https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync" /> and select the **Configure** button (top right) to open the repo selection page.

1. Select the **organization** or **account** for the repo you just created.

1. From the form, choose **Only select repositories**, open the **Select repositories** selector, and choose your repo from the list.

1. Select **Install** (or **Save**, see note above) to complete the Code Sync installation.

1. You should see a **success screen** if the installation completed without errors. Your repo is now connected to the Edge Delivery Services code bus.

1. (_Optional_) If you return to the <Link text="account selection page" href="https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync/installations/select_target" />, your repo's organization or account will now be gray with "Configure" added. Select your org or account again to access the **Code Sync configuration page**. This page shows when the app was added to your organization (highlighted) and allows you to connect the Code Sync app to additional repositories.

</Callouts>

### Create your content folder

Now let's create and set up the content side of your storefront. We'll create a new folder and share it with Edge Delivery Services.

Follow these steps to create your https://da.live content folder.

<Aside type="note" title="Demo Content">
If you do not want demo content, you can create a file in https://da.live/#/{org}/{site}/ replacing `{org}` and `{site}` with your own. This will "reserve" the org and site for you.
</Aside>

<Callouts>
1. Open the [demo content clone tool](https://da.live/app/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/tools/site-creator/site-creator).
1. Copy your GitHub repository url to the input field and click "Create site".
1. Follow the prompts, and by the end the content will have been copied to your destination folder.
1. You may have to manually preview or publish the content, depending on whether you followed the prerequisites.
</Callouts>
</Task>

<Task>

### Set up Sidekick for content

{/* <Diagram caption="Set up Sidekick.">![Set up Sidekick.](images/setup-sidekick.webp)</Diagram> */}


1. Review documentation about using and installing [the AEM Sidekick](https://www.aem.live/docs/sidekick).
1. If you are using the Config Service, you should ensure the `sidekick` property of your config with the below at minimum:
1. If you are not using the Config Service, you need to create a file in your code repo at `tools/sidekick/config.json` with the below at minimum.
  ```json
  {
    "project": "My Project",
    "editUrlLabel": "Document Authoring",
    "editUrlPattern": "https://da.live/edit#/{{org}}/{{site}}{{pathname}}",
  }
  ```

<Aside type="note" title="">
You can now use Sidekick to **Preview**, **Publish**, and **Edit** all your files directly from your content folder. Take a moment to select any file in your folder, select the Sidekick extension, and choose the Sidekick options to get familiar with how Sidekick works. Visit the [Sidekick documentation](https://www.aem.live/docs/sidekick) for more information on how to use Sidekick to manage your storefront content.

### Set up local dev environment

<Steps>
1. Go to your GitHub repo and select the **Code** button to copy the repo's git URL for cloning (HTTPS or SSH).
1. Open a terminal on your local machine and clone your storefront repo:

    ```bash frame="none"
    git clone [HTTPS or SSH URL]
    ```

1. Navigate to the root of your local repo and install the dependencies.

   ```bash frame="none"
   npm install
   ```

1. Start the development server to view the boilerplate storefront.

   ```bash frame="none"
   npm start
   ```

   The first page of your boilerplate storefront should be visible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

   <Screenshot src={BoilerplateHomePage} alt="Boilerplate Home Page" width="740px" />

1. Open the project in your favorite code editor. You're now ready to explore the boilerplate and start customizing your storefront!
