## Adding Links using the route pattern

Whenever possible, avoid placing `onClick` handlers directly on anchor elements (`<a>`) in drop-in components, such as product or category pages, as this results in accessibility issues and broken browser behavior. Problems include:

- Right-click > Open in New Tab results in blank pages.
- Middle-click (open in background tab) won't work as expected.
- Keyboard navigation and screen readers may not trigger the link correctly.

Instead, follow the route pattern to provide composable and accessible navigation.

## How it works

Components accept a `routeX` function as a prop. The function receives a data model (a product, for example) and returns a URL. Internally, it's used like this:

```tsx
<a href={routeProduct?.(product) ?? '#'}>...</a>
```

This lets developers customize routing logic per storefront while preserving link semantics.

## Example — Component-Side

In your component (a PLP item, for example):

The `routeProduct` prop must be optional and default to a # or an non-functional element like a `div` if not provided.

```tsx
type Props = {
  routeProduct?: (product: ProductModel) => string;
};

function ProductCard({ product, routeProduct }: Props) {
  return (
    <a href={routeProduct?.(product) ?? '#'}>
      <div>{product.name}</div>
    </a>
  );
}
```

## Example — Storefront-Side

In the storefront integration (`commerce-cart.js` or `commerce-plp.js`, for example):

```js
import { rootLink } from '@adobe/commerce-url-utils';

provider.render(ProductList, {
  routeProduct: (product) => rootLink(`/products/${product.url.urlKey}/${product.topLevelSku}`),
});
```
