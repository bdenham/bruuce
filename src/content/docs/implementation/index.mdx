## Composability

Headless Adobe Commerce storefronts on Edge Delivery Services are built using a composable architecture with domain-driven commerce components ([dropins](/dropins/all/introduction/)). This architecture allows you to build and deploy a storefront that is composed of multiple Adobe services, each with its own responsibility. Dropins are connected through APIs and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently for faster development cycles.

Dropins rely on Adobe Commerce and Catalog Service APIs to provide data and functionality. These components are designed to be reusable and can be shared across multiple projects. They are integrated out-of-the-box with Edge Delivery Services through the Commerce boilerplate. Adobe Commerce storefronts on Edge Delivery Services are compatible with doc-based authoring, which allows business users to create and manage content without developer intervention.

The following diagram illustrates the composable architecture of a headless Adobe Commerce storefront on Edge Delivery Services:
