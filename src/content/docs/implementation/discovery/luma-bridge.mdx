This section provides guidance on how to implement the Luma Bridge for your Adobe Commerce on Edge Delivery Services project.

Before starting an implementation, clarify the following:

  * Architecture of the cart, checkout, and account pages
  * Complexity of the cart, checkout, and account pages
  * Requirements for customization of the cart, checkout, and account pages

This information will help you decide whether to use Luma Bridge or a headless implementation for the cart, checkout, and account pages.

## What is Luma Bridge?

Luma bridge is an implementation for Adobe Commerce on Edge Delivery Services projects where the complex transactional part of the store (cart, checkout, account) is reused instead of being rebuilt during the project.

If the previous discovery steps led to the conclusion that dropins can be used for cart, checkout, and account experiences, Luma Bridge is not necessary or can be reduced to parts that are not covered by dropins (for example, complex customizations). If existing headless implementations for cart, checkout, and account ([PWA Studio](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio), [Vue Storefront](https://vuestorefront.io/)) are available, Luma Bridge is not necessary.

Rebuilding the cart, checkout, and account pages as part of a project is usually not feasible. Instead, Adobe recommends reusing existing cart, checkout, and account pages based on Luma PHP. You can use Luma Bridge to route the shopper to the PHP-based cart, checkout, and account pages.
