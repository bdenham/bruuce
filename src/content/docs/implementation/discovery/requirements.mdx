When connecting your storefront dropins to your own instance of Adobe Commerce, you must ensure that your Commmerce backend is configured with the services described here. These services are required for Commerce dropins to function properly.

For a complete list of merchandising services available for your Adobe Commerce storefront, refer to the [Adobe Commerce Services Guides](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/home). Direct links to the required services are provided below.

## What are storefront services?

Storefront services are a set of multi-tenant services (shared app, many users, separate data) that provide access to storefront data via GraphQL APIs. These services are very fast and are not tied to scaling constraints of a Commerce environment. They provide read-only access to catalog data, which can drive product detail and list pages, search, navigation, and product recommendations. [Synchronized data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas) is stored in a "SaaS data space" available through Adobe IMS. 

Availability and setup of these services are a hard requirement for building a storefront on Edge Delivery Services because only these APIs provide the performance to build sites with a 100 Lighthouse score. The storefront services APIs are available in addition to the core Adobe Commerce [GraphQL APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql/). 
    
This page provides an overview of the services required for your Adobe Commerce storefront.

### Data Connection service

The Data Connection extension connects your Adobe Commerce storefront to the Adobe Experience Platform and the Edge Network so that you can enrich and personalize the shopping experience for your customers. Refer to the [Data Connection Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/data-connection/overview) for details and installation instructions.

### Catalog Service

The Catalog Service module provides fast read-only access to Commerce catalog data. The Product Details dropin requires this service to render product data in the storefront. Refer to the [Catalog Service Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/catalog-service/guide-overview) for details and installation instructions.

### Live Search

The Live Search service replaces the default Commerce catalog search and installs the Product Listing Page (PLP) widget in your storefront. Refer to the [Live Search Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/overview) for details and installation instructions.

:::caution[Multiple stores in a single Adobe Commerce environment]
When using a single Adobe Commerce environment for multiple stores and only a single store should be migrated to Edge Delivery Services, please raise this with the Adobe team on Slack to ensure that Live Search is activated without disabling Elasticsearch, which should continue to drive the search of the other stores.

### Product Recommendations

Product Recommendations uses artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms ([Adobe Sensei](https://business.adobe.com/products/sensei/adobe-sensei.html)) to create personalized storefront experiences. While not a strict requirement, we recommended it for Commerce storefronts. Refer to the [Product Recommendations Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/product-recommendations/guide-overview) for details and installation instructions.

It provides data for product recommendations for the current shopper context and surfaces "units" such as "Customers who viewed this product also viewed" and can be placed in several areas of the site. You can configure the behavior of the service in Adobe Commerce Admin.
