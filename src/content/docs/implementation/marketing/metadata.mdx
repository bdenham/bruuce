Although Google is fine with metadata set by client-side JavaScript, social media platforms ignore it. For these platforms, metadata must be rendered server-side.

Adobe recommends importing product metadata into Edge Delivery Services so that it can be rendered server-side on product detail pages. This is important so that Google Merchant Center can reliably verify entries from your product sheet. Also, social media sites, which don't usually parse JavaScript, can leverage this metadata to display rich previews of your product page links.

## Recommendations

Verify that all pages, including catalog pages (PDP and PLP), have the following metadata:

* Document title via `title` tag
* Metadata via `meta` tags:
  * `description`
  * `keywords`
  * `og:type`
  * `og:title`
  * `og:description`
  * `og:url`
  * `og:image`
  * `og:image:secure_url`
  * `og:product:price:amount`
  * `og:product:price:currency`

## Generate metadata

You can use the [PDP Metadata Generator](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/tree/main/tools/pdp-metadata) tool to automate this process. The tool is designed to fetch product data from the Catalog Service, process it, and generate a metadata spreadsheet in `.xslx` format, which can be used for the [bulk metadata](https://www.aem.live/docs/bulk-metadata) feature in Edge Delivery Services.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js installed on your machine
* Access to the Catalog Service with the necessary API keys and configuration

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
1. Navigate to the project directory.
1. Install the dependencies.
  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

Before running the tool, you must ensure that the `configFile` variable in the `pdp-metadata.js` file points to the correct configuration JSON file URL. This file contains the required parameters to access the Catalog Service and should have been setup as part of your project onboarding.

### Usage

Start the tool to fetch product data, process it, and generate a file named `metadata.xlsx` in the project directory.

```bash
npm start
```
