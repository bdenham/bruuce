This guide will walk you through the process of localizing the content of your storefront using Document Authoring (da.live).

## Prerequisites

- You have a storefront project in the Document Authoring app (<Link href="https://da.live" text="da.live" />) of the Storefront Builder.
- You know the basics of using the Document Authoring tool as described in the documentation here: (<Link href="https://da.live/docs" text="da.live/docs" />).

:::note
To achieve full localization—including storefront setup (currency, translations, localized storefront links) and enabling the store switcher—the developers for your storefront site need to follow the steps outlined in [multistore setup](/merchants/multistore/).

### Use the Traverse app to get a list of site URLs

<Steps>
1. Open the **Traverse** app by selecting its *Go* button.
1. On the Crawl Tree page, enter your storefront's organization name and site name. Example: `/acme/storefront`. Ensure that you enter a forward slash (`/`) at the beginning of the string or it will not work. 
1. Select the **Crawl** button to start the crawl.
1. Select the **Copy list** button after the site's URLs have been traversed. This puts all the URLs in your clipboard.
1. Return to the Apps page.

</Steps>

### Use the Translation app to translate your storefront

<Steps>
1. Open the **Translate** app by selecting its *Go* button.
1. On the Localization page, enter the Title of the translation project: `acme-storefront-fr`.
1. Paste the list of URLs from the **Traverse** app into the **URLs** field.
   :::note
   We recommend excluding certain files—such as `metadata.json`, `redirects.json`, and `sitemap.json`—from the translation process. Adding these files to the translation process shouldn't cause any technical issues with translation, but translating them is not necessary.
   :::
1. Select the **Next** button.
1. View the validated URLs to ensure that they are all correct.
1. Select the **Next** button.
1. Select one or more languages you want to translate to. In this example, we will translate to French (`fr`).
1. For the French language, select **Translate** from the selector, then select the **Create project** button.
1. From the project page, select the **Send all for translation** button.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">

By default, the Translation app will use the Google Translate service to translate the content of the storefront into the selected language. Your organization can also connect other translation services for a more robust translation experience. For more information on translation services and configuration, see [Translation and Localization](https://www.aem.live/docs/translation-and-localization).
