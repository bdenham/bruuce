Adobe Commerce uses a [hierarchical structure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/start/setup/websites-stores-views) to manage multiple stores within a single instance. This structure consists of three levels: websites, stores, and store views. Localization is managed at the store view level, allowing merchants to present the store in different languages and apply the proper currency.

To maintain storefronts that implement Edge Delivery Services, you must be familiar with its building blocks. The following topics describe the EDS features.

* [Authoring and Publishing Content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/document-authoring/authoring)
* [Placeholders files](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/resources/placeholders/)
* [Adobe Commerce Configuration Scope](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/config/scope-change)
* [Storefront Configuration](/setup/configuration/commerce-configuration/)
* [Folder Mapping](https://www.aem.live/developer/folder-mapping)

## Big Picture

Multi-store refers to a streamlined architecture that enables managing multiple stores with unique catalogs and localization while leveraging a shared code base and unified content delivery. The content hierarchy follows [Edge Delivery Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview) best practices, emphasizing a single-tier structure.

Content is organized primarily by language. US English files should be placed in the `en` directory of the project root. All other language- and region-specific files should be placed in a directory that is named in the format `*region-code_language-code*`. For example, the `/en/` directory contains data for the US market, while the  `/en_ca/` directory contains data for Canada. French content should be placed in directories with names like `fr_fr` for France and `fr_ca` for Canada.

The Document Authoring Content file structure of a multi-store is shown below.

<FileTree>
- **/en/** _-- English store (Default root language)_
  - placeholders/** _-- Stores JSON files for text and UI components for the English US store._
  - index _-- The home page of the English US store._
  - store-switcher _-- Manages the list of stores and their URL for the English US store._
- **/en_ca/** _-- English Canadian Store_
  - placeholders/** _-- Defines JSON files for text and UI components for the Canadian store._
  - index _-- The home page of the English Canadian store._
  - store-switcher _-- Manages the list of stores and their URL for the Canadian store._
</FileTree>

Default files are provided in the sample content. These files can be customized to suit your needs.


## Store-specific files

The content, placeholders, and store switcher files help define the experience in each store view as described here.

### Store Switcher

Each store view has its own `store-switcher` document file called a fragment. This fragment provides the list of stores to select from by language. The store-switcher component renders a button in the footer that opens a modal containing the stores listed in this document.

Start by creating a `store-switcher` file containing a bulleted list inside each store view root folder. Each line must define the display name of your store with an active link to the store, as shown below:

```text
**Select a store:**

- United States (USD)
  - [United States (USD)](https://main--aem-boilerplate-commerce--hlxsites.aem.page/en/#nolocal)
- Canada (CAD)
  - [Canada (EN)](https://main--aem-boilerplate-commerce--hlxsites.aem.page/en_ca/#nolocal)
```

**Important**: The storefront will automatically update links to be relative to the root path of the storefront. For links you don't want to be localized (such as store switcher links), add the hash `#nolocal` to ensure these remain absolute to the site. This is particularly useful for store switchers as you want to be able to navigate to different store paths within the same site.

### Content files

The content files provide the structure of the pages served to your shoppers. They are located in the store view directories and contain the content for each store view. These files are documents hosted on `https://da.live` (Document Author environment), SharePoint `.docx`, or Google that are used to generate the store view pages. These files should be localized for the desired region and language.


### Placeholders

The placeholders directory contains JSON files that define reusable variables for text and UI components displayed on your storefront. Each drop-in component has its own placeholders file (e.g., `cart.json`, `checkout.json`, `pdp.json`). These files replace variables in your content files with the appropriate text values.

## Storefront Configuration

### Folder Mapping

Product Detail Pages (PDP) are mapped to a single document at `products/default`.
When adding a new store view, you'll need to add a corresponding folder mapping for the new URLs.

#### fstab.yaml

If your project uses a `fstab.yaml` file, add the new store view mapping under the `folders:` section, like this:

```yaml
mountpoints:
  /: https://example.mountpoint.com/:f:/r/sites/myproject

folders:
  /en/products/: /en/products/default
  /en_ca/products/: /en_ca/products/default
```

#### Config Service

If your project uses the Config Service, you must update the configuration to add the new store view mapping under the `folders:` section, like this:

```json
{
  "folders": {
    "/en/products/": "/en/products/default",
    "/en_ca/products/": "/en_ca/products/default"
  }
}
```

To learn more about the Config Service, please see [aem.live's documentation](https://www.aem.live/docs/config-service-setup) or read the [api documentation](https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html#tag/siteConfig/operation/updateConfigSite) to learn how to publish your updates to the Config Service for your site.

### Site Config

You must update your [storefront config](/setup/configuration/commerce-configuration/) to include configuration overrides for the new store view. In this file, you'll define store-view specific settings, such as service headers and analytics values. The `key` of each overridden object must match the root folder path of the corresponding store view. These values will be merged into the default configuration.

The `analytics` section contains the Adobe Commerce environment variables for the store view. These variables are used by the Analytics API. For more details, see [Analytics](/setup/analytics/instrumentation).

```json
{
  "public": {
    "default": {
      // default configuration
    },
    "/en/": {}, // inherits the default
    "/en_ca/": {
      "headers": {
        // overrides values from the default headers
      },
      "analytics": {
        // overrides values from the default analytics configuration
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step-by-Step

These steps show you how to add a new English Canadian store view (`en_ca`) similar to the default English store (`en`).

<Tasks>

<Task>
### Add a new store

Create an `en_ca` store view in the Commerce Admin and perform the following steps in your project.

<Steps>
1. Create the `/en_ca/` folder under the project root in your content folder. You can name this folder anything you want, as long as it's unique and can be used in a web address. For example, instead of `Canada (English)`, you can use `ca_en`.

1. Copy the store switcher, placeholders directory, and document files from the `/en/` directory to the `/en_ca/` directory.
</Steps>

</Task>

<Task>
### Update Content Files

Next, localize or translate the files in your project.

<Steps>
1. Translate or localize content files in the `/en_ca/` folders.

1. Ensure all labels in the placeholders JSON files are accurately translated into the desired language. Update each component's placeholders file (e.g., `cart.json`, `checkout.json`, `pdp.json`) as needed.
</Steps>
</Task>

<Task>
### Update Storefront Configuration

:::note[Code Change Required]
This step requires updating configuration files in your project to support the new store view.
:::

<Steps>
1. Update the `fstab.yaml` file — or the `fstab` section of your [site config](https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html#tag/siteConfig) — to include the new folder mapping for the `/en_ca/` store view. This should map to the appropriate content path. For example, `/en_ca/products/` should map to `/en_ca/products/default`.

1. Update the `config.json` file - or the `public` section of your [site config](https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html#tag/siteConfig) - to include a new entry under in the `public` object for `/en_ca/`. Use this section to define store-specific values such as headers, analytics, and more, if they differ from the default. Make sure the `key` matches the folder path of your store view.  For example,  the `/en_ca/` key for your Canadian store). Values in this object will override those in the default configuration.


1. If you are using the Config Service, read the [api documentation](https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html#tag/siteConfig/operation/updateConfigSite) to learn how to publish your updates to the Config Service for your site.

</Steps>
</Task>

<Task>
### Preview and validate

Finally, preview and publish the new store view.

<Steps>
1. Preview all files in the updated folder `/en_ca/` with [AEM Sidekick](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/resources/sidekick/sidekick).

1. Validate the storefront experience by accessing the new language/region and testing the rendering, navigation, and data accuracy.

1. Publish the updated folder using the AEM Sidekick folder when ready.

1. Update the `store-switcher` content document to include a link to the new store view.
