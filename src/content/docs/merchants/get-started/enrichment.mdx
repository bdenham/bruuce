This topic introduces you to the concept of enriching product pages in your storefront. You will learn how to add content blocks above or below a commerce block (or any other block).

## Key concepts

<Vocabulary>

### Enrichment

Enrichment means to add content that strengthens the user experience of the drop-in on the webpage. When viewing a product's details (via the product-details drop-in), the user experiences all the core features of the drop-in. However, all the other extra content on the page, like product recommendations, must be added in one of the ways described in this topic.

### Content blocks

Content blocks are tables in a document that contain text, images, or other media. They are used to structure and organize content on a webpage. See <Link href="https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection" text="Block collection" /> for more information.

### Commerce blocks

Commerce blocks are Edge Delivery Service blocks that contain drop-in components. Commerce blocks are used to add drop-in components like the product-details block that features a specific product.


### Enrichment blocks

Enrichment blocks are specialized content blocks to dynamically display content above or below commerce blocks based on various conditions, including but not limited to product SKUs and category numbers.

### Content positioning

Content positioning is the placement of content and enrichment blocks on a webpage. It includes the arrangement of content blocks above or below a commerce blocks. Positioning content inside a drop-in component is also possible using the slot API functions. The webpage structure is within a Word or Google docs file. This file includes tables that define content blocks, commerce blocks, and other HTML elements.
