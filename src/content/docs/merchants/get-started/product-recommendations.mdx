The `ProductList` container can be configured on each page through Document Authoring. Follow the step-by-step guide below to enable and configure Product Recommendations:

### Add and configure the recommendations block

You can configure each page to display a specific recommendation unit by setting its recommendation ID.

<Steps>

1. Open the page where you want to display the recommendation unit.

1. Create a new table in your document. 

   For product detail pages, set the `recId` to match the recommendation unit ID in the previous step. For example:

   <Diagram caption="Add Product Recommendations block to the page">
   ![Add Product Recommendations block to the page](@images/PrexBlockPDP.png)
   </Diagram>

   :::note
   PDP pages require only the `recId` to be set.

   Other pages require both the `recId` and `currentSku` to be set. For example:

   <Diagram caption="Add Product Recommendations block to the page">
   ![Add Product Recommendations block to the page](@images/PrexBlockNonPDP.png)
   </Diagram>
