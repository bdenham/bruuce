The **Content and Commerce blocks** are pre-built, reusable UI components (carts, product lists, etc.) that can be seamlessly integrated into your storefront. They are defined using tables in the content and decorated by your custom code during page rendering. Drop-ins are dynamic, commerce-specific front-end components that can be integrated within a Block.
