The Document Authoring tool is the content management system (CMS) at the heart of the Commerce Storefront. It is where your storefront's pages, blocks, and assets are authored, organized, and managed. 

DA.live provides a collaborative environment for content teams to create and structure site content, manage translations, and control publishing workflows. It integrates with Visual Editor for in-context editing and with Edge Delivery Services for fast, reliable content delivery. DA.live supports versioning, localization, and multistore management, making it a powerful tool for complex commerce operations.
