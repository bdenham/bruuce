The **Visual Editor** is a powerful in-context editing tool that enables business users and content authors to edit website content directly on the page with real-time preview. Built on Adobe's Universal Editor technology, it provides an intuitive interface for updating text, images, blocks, and drop-ins without requiring technical knowledge or switching between different tools.

With Visual Editor, you can make immediate changes to your storefront content and see the results instantly, eliminating the need for separate preview environments or publishing cycles. This tool is particularly valuable for marketing teams, content creators, and business users who need to quickly update product descriptions, promotional content, or page layouts to respond to market demands or campaign requirements.

#### Key Capabilities

- **Real-time Editing**: Make changes to text, images, blocks, and drop-ins directly on the page with instant visual feedback
- **In-context Experience**: Edit content without switching context, publishing, or previewing in separate environments
- **Content Navigation**: Use the side panel to navigate the content structure and hierarchy of your website
- **Form-based Views**: Access form-based editing interfaces for components and blocks on your website
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with asset management, publishing workflows, and other Adobe Commerce tools
- **Extensibility Framework**: Supports Adobe-provided extensions (like product picker and asset picker) as well as custom extensions built by customers and partners

#### Technical Implementation

The Universal Editor integration requires three key configuration files in your Storefront Builder project:

1. **Component Definitions**: Define the basic properties of each block/component, including title, ID, and optional HTML templates for new component creation
2. **Component Models**: Specify the editable fields for each component (such as reference fields for asset picker integration and rich text fields for content editing)
3. **Component Filters**: Control which components are allowed in specific page areas or sections

For new Storefront Builder projects, these configuration files come pre-generated with definitions for 40+ blocks, requiring only customization for additional content blocks you create.

This tool streamlines content workflows, reduces time-to-market for updates, and ensures that your storefront always reflects the latest campaigns, promotions, and brand messaging. Visual Editor is fully integrated with DA.live and supports localization and multistore editing.
