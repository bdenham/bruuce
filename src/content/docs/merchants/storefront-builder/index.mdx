**Storefront Builder** is included with Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service, and is designed to streamline both the technical and editorial workflows for building and maintaining commerce storefronts. 

## What is the Storefront Builder?

The **Storefront Builder** is a collection of tools and technologies from Adobe Commerce designed to make it easy to create, manage, and customize modern, high-performance storefronts. It brings together the following elements of a commerce storefront:

- **DA.live (Document Authoring Live)**: The content management system where your storefront's pages, blocks, and assets are authored and managed.
- **Content and Commerce Blocks**: Pre-built, reusable UI components (like carts, product lists, etc.) that can be easily added to your storefront.
- **Edge Delivery Services (EDS)**: A fast, scalable delivery platform for your storefront content and assets.
- **Visual Editor**: A visual, in-context editing tool that lets business users and content authors update storefront content directly, with real-time preview.
- **Digital Asset Management (DAM)**: For storing and managing editorial assets like images and other media used on content pages and product enrichments in your storefront.

### DA.live (Document Authoring Live)

DA.live (Document Authoring) is the content management system (CMS) at the heart of Storefront Builder. It is where your storefront's pages, blocks, and assets are authored, organized, and managed. DA.live provides a collaborative environment for content teams to create and structure site content, manage translations, and control publishing workflows. It integrates with Visual Editor for in-context editing and with EDS for fast, reliable content delivery. DA.live supports versioning, localization, and multistore management, making it a powerful tool for complex commerce operations.

### Edge Delivery Services (EDS)

Edge Delivery Services (EDS) is a fast, scalable platform for delivering your storefront's content and assets to customers. EDS leverages a global content delivery network (CDN) to ensure that pages, images, and other resources load quickly, no matter where your customers are located. By serving content from the edge, EDS reduces latency and improves site performance, which is critical for both user experience and SEO. EDS is tightly integrated with the Storefront Builder ecosystem, ensuring seamless deployment and updates of your storefront content.

### Content and Commerce Blocks

Drop-ins and Blocks are pre-built, reusable UI components that can be easily added to your storefront. Examples include shopping carts, product lists, navigation menus, and more. These components are designed to accelerate storefront development by providing ready-made, best-practice implementations for common commerce features. Drop-ins are typically more dynamic and commerce-aware, while blocks are often used for layout and content structuring. Both can be configured and extended to match your brand and business needs, and are fully compatible with localization and multistore setups.

### Visual Editor (Universal Editor)

Visual Editor is a visual, in-context editing tool that empowers business users and content authors to update storefront content directly on the page, with real-time preview. With Visual Editor, you can make changes to text, images, blocks, and drop-ins without needing to write code or wait for developer assistance. This tool streamlines content workflows, reduces time-to-market for updates, and ensures that your storefront always reflects the latest campaigns, promotions, and brand messaging. Visual Editor is fully integrated with DA.live and supports localization and multistore editing.

### Product Visuals

Product Visuals is an integration of product assets into the ACCS backend. For Storefront Builder, the digital asset management (DAM) solution accesseseditorial assets like images, videos, and other media used on content pages and product enrichments. The DAM integrates with DA.live and Visual Editor for seamless media content management and works with EDS to deliver optimized assets globally.

### CLI

The CLI (Command Line Interface) tool automates the setup and configuration of a new Edge Delivery Commerce storefront. Here is an overview of what the CLI does from start to finish:

<Steps>
1. **Initialize the Project**: Prompts you for basic information such as your organization, site name, and destination for your storefront.

2. **Create the Code Repository**: Automatically creates a new code repository (or uses an existing one) for your storefront's codebase.

3. **Select and Apply a Template**: Lets you choose a boilerplate or template to use as the foundation for your storefront, ensuring best practices and a quick start.

4. **Configure Site Settings**: Sets up essential configuration files, including those for multistore, localization, and connections to your commerce backend.

5. **Connect to Commerce Backend**: Guides you through connecting your storefront to the appropriate commerce environment, including setting up API endpoints and authentication headers.

6. **Provision Content in DA.live**: Uploads and configures starter content in DA.live (Document Authoring Live), so your storefront has pages, blocks, and assets ready to go.

7. **Instrument for Visual Editor**: Sets up the necessary files and configuration so your storefront is compatible with the Visual Editor, enabling in-context editing for business users.

8. **Preview and Publish**: Provides options to preview your storefront and publish content, ensuring everything is working as expected before going live.

9. **Finalize and Output**: Outputs a ready-to-use storefront with all code, content, and configuration in place. You can now further customize, extend, and manage your storefront as needed.

</Steps>

This end-to-end automation reduces manual setup, accelerates time-to-market, and ensures your storefront is built on a solid, up-to-date foundation.

### Site Creator UI

The Site Creator UI is a web-based tool that guides you through the setup process with a user interface. It is useful for those who prefer not to use the command line.

### Manual Setup

You can also follow step-by-step documentation to set up your storefront manually, which is useful for learning or for custom setups.
