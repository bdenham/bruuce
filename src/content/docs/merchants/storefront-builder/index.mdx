**Storefront Builder** is included with Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service, and is designed to streamline both the technical and editorial workflows for creating and maintaining the content for your commerce storefronts. 

## What is the Storefront Builder?

The **Storefront Builder** is a collection of tools and technologies from Adobe Commerce designed to make it easy to create, manage, and customize modern, high-performance storefronts. It brings together the following elements of a commerce storefront:

- **DA.live (Document Authoring Live)**: The content management system where your storefront's pages, blocks, and assets are authored and managed.
- **Content and Commerce Blocks**: Pre-built, reusable UI components (carts, product lists, etc.) that can be seamlessly integrated into your storefront.
- **Edge Delivery Services (EDS)**: A fast, scalable delivery platform for your storefront content and assets.
- **Visual Editor**: A visual, in-context editing tool that lets business users and content authors update storefront content directly, with real-time preview.
- **Digital Asset Management (DAM)**: For storing and managing editorial assets like images and other media used on content pages and product enrichments in your storefront.

### DA.live (Document Authoring)

DA.live (Document Authoring) is the content management system (CMS) at the heart of Storefront Builder. It is where your storefront's pages, blocks, and assets are authored, organized, and managed. DA.live provides a collaborative environment for content teams to create and structure site content, manage translations, and control publishing workflows. It integrates with Visual Editor for in-context editing and with Edge Delivery Services for fast, reliable content delivery. DA.live supports versioning, localization, and multistore management, making it a powerful tool for complex commerce operations.

Learn more about DA.live in the [DA.live tutorial](https://www.aem.live/developer/da-tutorial).

### Edge Delivery Services

Edge Delivery Services is a fast, scalable platform for delivering your storefront's content and assets to customers. It leverages a global content delivery network (CDN) to ensure that pages, images, and other resources load quickly, no matter where your customers are located. By serving content from the edge, EDS reduces latency and improves site performance, which is critical for both user experience and SEO. Edge Delivery Services is tightly integrated with the Storefront Builder ecosystem, ensuring seamless deployment and updates of your storefront content.

### Content and Commerce blocks

Blocks are a foundational concept for adding form and function to page sections. They are defined using tables in the content and decorated by your custom code during page rendering. Drop-ins are dynamic, commerce-specific front-end components that can be integrated within a Block.

Learn how to use the Content and Commerce blocks in the [Content and Commerce blocks](/merchants/storefront-builder/content-commerce-blocks/) topic.

For more information about content blocks, see the [Block Collection](https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection) topic.

### Visual Editor (Universal Editor features)

Visual Editor, powered by Adobe's Universal Editor, is a powerful visual editing tool that enables business users and content authors to edit website content in real-time with immediate live preview. This in-context editing experience eliminates the need to switch between different tools or wait for publishing cycles to see changes.

Learn how to use the Visual Editor in the [Using the Visual Editor](/merchants/storefront-builder/visual-editor/) topic.

For more information about the Universal Editor, see [Universal Editor authoring](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/universal-editor/authoring).


### Product Visuals

[Product Visuals](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/product-visuals/overview) is an integration of Adobe Experience Manager Assets with your Adobe Commerce backend. For Storefront Builder, the digital asset management (DAM) solution accesses editorial assets like images, videos, and other media used on content pages and product enrichments. The DAM integrates with DA.live and Visual Editor for seamless media content management and works with Edge Delivery Services to deliver optimized assets globally.
