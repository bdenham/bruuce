**Storefront Builder** is Adobe's integrated content management system (CMS) designed specifically for Commerce Storefronts powered by Edge Delivery Services. This purpose-built solution eliminates the friction of choosing between basic content providers like SharePoint or Google Drive and the complexity of upgrading to full AEM Sites. With Storefront Builder, merchants can create, manage, and publish storefront content faster and easier, with minimal training required, while leveraging enterprise-grade performance and reliability.

## Key Features

### Performance at Scale
- **Fast APIs**: Handle at least 1,000 documents per minute
- **Edge-engineered**: Built for high availability and global performance
- **Native Edge Delivery**: Zero code changes needed for content delivery

### Enterprise-Grade Capabilities
- **Business-class features**: Bulk content tools, healthcare-grade versioning, and detailed audit logs
- **AEM Integration**: Seamless connection with AEM as a Cloud Service for advanced asset and taxonomy management
- **100% Compatible**: Mix and match with existing SharePoint and Google Drive content sources
