### Add Teaser blocks

- **Teaser 1:**  
    - **Header:** “Meet your new personal assistant”  
    - **Content:** “It's expected to rain today on your way to work, don't forget your umbrella”
    - **Image:** Pick an image from the AEM Assets library.
- **Teaser 2:**  
    - **Header:** “Your best fitness pal”  
    - **Content:** “Monitor your progress and maximize your results”
    - **Image:** Pick an image from the AEM Assets library.
- **Teaser 3:**  
    - **Header:** “New to City Signal?”  
    - **Content:** “Check out our special trial offer”
    - **Image:** Pick an image from the AEM Assets library.
- **Teaser 4:**  
    - **No header**  
    - **Content:** “Bundle and save, check eligibility now”
    - **Image:** Pick an image from the AEM Assets library.
- **Teaser 5:**  
    - **No header**  
    - **Content:** “Students save with City Signal more”

### Update content layout

Your product template uses a 2x2 layout. To change it:

    - Go to the `<section-metadata>` block.
    - Change the style from `grid-row` to `grid-column`.

In the preview, the teasers will reflow to a 1x3 layout if three are in the section.
