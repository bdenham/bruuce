In this lab, you will take on and experience what it's like to use the Storefront Builder with Adobe Commerce Storefront whose daily job involves optimizing the storefront for customer conversions and creating new product pages, marketing campaigns, and customer conversion experiments.

## Scenario

Imagine that Apple is releasing its latest iPhone and your company, City Signal, wants to launch a catalog update and promotional campaign related to this event. 

In this lab, you will prepare a product campaign that:

- Features a product page for the new iPhone
- Promotes the new iPhone with a campaign that targets a generic audience and loyal customers with special offers
- Experiments with customer conversions from the cart
