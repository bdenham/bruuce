The personalization drop-in provides a set of tools and containers designed to display the content conditionally, based on the Adobe Commerce customer group, segments and cart price rules.

## Overview

The personalization drop-in provides the Targeted Block container that requires specifying the content (or path to the fragment with the content) and (optionally) block type, Adobe Commerce customer groups, segments and cart rules for the customer the content has to be displayed to.

The drop-in's initialization sets the listeners to the events changing the state of authentication and cart.

The listeners are requesting the currently applied customer group, segments and cart price rules from Adobe Commerce and saving them to the cookie.

When the TargetedBlock container is added to the page, it is displayed only if the customer group, segments and cart price rules passed to the block are within the applied groups, segments and rules saved in the cookie.

If the block type is specified for the TargetedBlock, only the first targeted block of each type is rendered allowing to create a fallback chain of targeted blocks.
