Learn about the slots provided in the checkout drop-in component.

[Extending drop-in components](/dropins/all/extending/) describes the default properties available to all slots.

## PaymentMethods slots

The slots for the [`PaymentMethods`](/dropins/checkout/containers/payment-methods/) container are defined in the `PaymentMethodsProps` interface shown below. The slots allow you to customize the list of payment methods to show during the checkout process.

```ts
export interface PaymentMethodsProps extends HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {
  /**
   * @deprecated This property is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
   * Please use the "slots.Methods" property instead to provide this information.
   */
  setOnChange?: { [key: string]: boolean };
  slots?: {
    /**
     * @deprecated This property is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
     * Please use the "slots.Methods" property instead to provide this information.
     */
    Handlers?: PaymentMethodsHandlerSlot;
    Methods?: PaymentMethodsSlot;
  };
}
```

### Methods

The `Methods` property is an object which implements the `PaymentMethodsSlot` interface:

```ts
export interface PaymentMethodsSlot {
  [code: string]: PaymentMethodConfig;
}
```

It consists on a list of payment method codes providing a set of configurations to customize the payment method. Each payment method will have its own set of configurations implementing the `PaymentMethodConfig` interface:

```ts
export interface PaymentMethodConfig {
  displayLabel?: boolean;
  enabled?: boolean;
  icon?: string;
  setOnChange?: boolean;
  render?: SlotProps<PaymentMethodRenderCtx>;
}
```

Finally the `render` property is a callback function used to render and configure the payment method in case of being selected. The `render` slot receives a context implementing the following `PaymentMethodRenderCtx` interface:

```ts
export type SlotProps<T = any> = (
  ctx: T & DefaultSlotContext<T>,
  element: HTMLDivElement | null
) => Promise<void> | void;

export interface PaymentMethodRenderCtx {
  cartId: string;
  replaceHTML: (domElement: HTMLElement) => void;
}
```

The context object passed to the `render` slot includes a _replaceHTML_ property that is a callback function and the _cartId_ got from the internal state.

## PlaceOrder slots

The slots for the [`PlaceOrder`](/dropins/checkout/containers/place-order/) container are defined in the `PlaceOrderProps` interface shown below. The slots allow you to set the container content dynamically based on the selected payment method.

```ts
export interface PlaceOrderProps extends HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {
  disabled?: boolean;
  handleValidation?: () => boolean;
  handlePlaceOrder: (ctx: HandlePlaceOrderContext) => Promise<void>;
  slots?: {
    Content?: SlotProps<ContentSlotContext>;
  };
}
```

### Content

The `Content` property is a callback function used to render the container content. The `Content` slot receives a context implementing the following `ContentSlotContext` interface:

```ts
export type SlotProps<T = any> = (
  ctx: T & DefaultSlotContext<T>,
  element: HTMLDivElement | null
) => Promise<void> | void;

export interface ContentSlotContext {
  code: string;
}
```

The context object passed to the `Content` slot includes the _code_ got from the selected payment method.
