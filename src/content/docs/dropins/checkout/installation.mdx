The Checkout dropin provides a customizable UI for the checkout process. The dropin is designed to be integrated into a your storefront and provides a seamless checkout experience for customers.

## Installation

Since the Checkout dropin relies on containers from several other dropins, you must install and configure these dropins before you can use the Checkout dropin.

The [Commerce boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce) includes all of the necessary dropins and configurations to help you get started quickly, so Adobe recommends relying on the boilerplate instead of installing, configuring, and integrating the dropins individually.

## Admin configuration

Before you can use the Checkout dropin on your storefront, you must enable and configure [payment providers](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/stores-sales/payments/payments) and [checkout options](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/stores-sales/point-of-purchase/checkout/checkout-process) in the Adobe Commerce Admin.
