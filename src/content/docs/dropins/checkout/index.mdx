The checkout drop-in component provides a variety of fully-customizable controls to help complete a purchase.

These controls include forms to introduce required information for contact details like email address, delivery and billing addresses, shipping options, and payment methods. Established customers who added items to the cart as a guest have the ability to sign in, automatically loading default addresses and contact details.
