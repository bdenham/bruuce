import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

In this section, we describe the common properties of Checkout components that can be applied and used in the same way.

## Conditional rendering

During the checkout process, some containers need to be rendered or not depending on the use of some conditions, in our case, data extracted from the cart state.
This is based on the HOC (High Order Component) concept, where there is a component which provides us with a way to reuse behavior and state logic between components. 

A HOC is a Javascript function that receives at least one component as a parameter and returns a new component by injecting the logic that you want to reuse through props. In other words, a HOC is a function that receives a component and returns a new enriched component. The main benefit of HOCs is the reuse of logic.

In our case, we have defined a function called `withConditionalRendering()` that receives a `Container` as a parameter and returns a `ConditionalContainer`. This `ConditionalContainer` accepts a couple of props (apart from the `Container`'s own) that will be used by the logic injected into it to decide whether the Checkout drop-in should render the container or not.

### ConditionalContainer configurations

The `ConditionalContainer` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['hideOnEmptyCart', 'boolean', 'No', 'Hides the container if the cart is empty (default value is true).'],
    ['hideOnVirtualCart', 'boolean', 'No', 'Hides the container if the cart is virtual (default value is false).'],
  ]}
/>

The structure of the `withConditionalRendering()` function is defined as following:

```ts
export interface ConditionalProps {
  hideOnEmptyCart?: boolean;
  hideOnVirtualCart?: boolean;
}

export const withConditionalRendering = <P extends object>(
  WrappedContainer: Container<P>
) => {
  const ConditionalContainer = ({
    hideOnEmptyCart = true,
    hideOnVirtualCart = false,
    ...props
  }: ConditionalProps & P) => {
    // Logic to hide the container goes here
  };

  return ConditionalContainer;
};
```

## Title and heading customization

Each container provides a title and a heading by default. If you want to hide the title or provide customized title, you can use the following interface.

### TitleProps interface

The `TitleProps` interface provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['displayTitle', 'boolean', 'No', 'Displays the title of the container.'],
    ['slots', 'object', 'No', 'Object with the content to be displayed on the title.'],
  ]}
/>

The container receives an object that implements the `TitleProps` interface with the following properties:

```ts
export interface TitleProps {
  displayTitle?: boolean;
  slots?: {
    Title?: SlotProps;
  };
}
```

<li>The `displayTitle` property set to _true_ displays the title of the container; otherwise, the title will be hidden.</li>

<li>The `slots` property is an object containing the following properties:</li>

#### Title property

The `Title` property is a handler used to render a customized title content.

:::note[Checkout containers]
As mentioned, the Checkout drop-in consists of several containers rendered based on cart conditions. In the following pages, we will describe all the Checkout containers indicating whether they need to be rendered based on those conditions, by accepting both `hideOnEmptyCart` and `hideOnVirtualCart` props.

Also we will see the containers which are able to customize the `Title` and we will describe how to use it merging props.
