import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

In this section, we describe the common properties of Checkout components that can be applied and used in the same way.

## Title and heading customization

Each container provides a title and a heading by default. If you want to hide the title or provide customized title, you can use the following interface.

### TitleProps interface

The `TitleProps` interface provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['displayTitle', 'boolean', 'No', 'Displays the title of the container.'],
    ['slots', 'object', 'No', 'Object with the content to be displayed on the title.'],
  ]}
/>

The container receives an object that implements the `TitleProps` interface with the following properties:

```ts
export interface TitleProps {
  displayTitle?: boolean;
  slots?: {
    Title?: SlotProps;
  };
}
```

<li>The `displayTitle` property set to _true_ displays the title of the container; otherwise, the title will be hidden.</li>

<li>The `slots` property is an object containing the following properties:</li>

#### Title property

The `Title` property is a handler used to render a customized title content.

## Active property

The `active` property controls whether the container is active, this means it is visible and responds to system events. When set to _false_, the container is not reactive, therefore it does not subscribe to system events and it's not rendered in the user interface.

### `active` prop declaration

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['active', 'boolean', 'No', 'Activates/deactivates the container (default value is true).'],
  ]}
/>

```ts
active?: boolean;
```

#### Behavior:

- When `active` is _true_:
  - The container subscribes to system events
  - It renders in the user interface and it is visible (shows a skeleton or renders the component in the UI)
  - It executes its normal operations
- When `active` is _false_:
  - The container does not subscribe to system events
  - It does not render in the user interface and its visibility is set to false
  - Side effects and state updates are not executed

### Example of `active` prop definition

In the following example, the `ShippingMethods` container will be deactivated; this means it will not be rendered to the UI and will not listen to system events.

```ts
CheckoutProvider.render(ShippingMethods, {
  UIComponentType: 'ToggleButton',
  displayTitle: false,
  active: false,
})($deliveryMethods),
```

## AutoSync property

The `autoSync` property determines whether the container automatically synchronizes its state changes with the backend via API calls. When set to _false_, the container does not automatically synchronize its state, but still maintains local updates.

### `autoSync` prop declaration

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['autoSync', 'boolean', 'No', 'Synchronizes/does not synchronize the container local state with the backend (default value is true).'],
  ]}
/>

```ts
autoSync?: boolean;
```

#### Behavior:

- When `autoSync` is _true_:
  - Local changes are synchronized with the backend
  - GraphQL mutations are executed when selection or local state changes
  - The remote cart is automatically updated
- When `autoSync` is _false_:
  - Changes are only maintained locally
  - No automatic GraphQL mutations are performed on the backend
  - Control of mutations is passed to parent or external components

#### Use cases:

- In multi-step checkout flows where you want to control when data is sent to the backend
- For nested containers where a parent container handles synchronization
- In implementations that need additional validation before sending data

### Example of `autoSync` prop definition

In the following example, the ShippingMethods container will not automatically synchronize its state changes with the backend; this means it will not set the shipping method selected on cart automatically.

```ts
CheckoutProvider.render(ShippingMethods, {
  UIComponentType: 'ToggleButton',
  displayTitle: false,
  autoSync: false,
})($deliveryMethods),
```
