import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

In this section, we describe the common properties of Checkout components that can be applied and used in the same way.

## Title and heading customization

Each container provides a title and a heading by default. If you want to hide the title or provide customized title, you can use the following interface.

### TitleProps interface

The `TitleProps` interface provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['displayTitle', 'boolean', 'No', 'Displays the title of the container.'],
    ['slots', 'object', 'No', 'Object with the content to be displayed on the title.'],
  ]}
/>

The container receives an object that implements the `TitleProps` interface with the following properties:

```ts
export interface TitleProps {
  displayTitle?: boolean;
  slots?: {
    Title?: SlotProps;
  };
}
```

<li>The `displayTitle` property set to _true_ displays the title of the container; otherwise, the title will be hidden.</li>

<li>The `slots` property is an object containing the following properties:</li>

#### Title property

The `Title` property is a handler used to render a customized title content.
