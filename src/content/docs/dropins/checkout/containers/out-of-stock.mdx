import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `OutOfStock` container is designed to handle and display items in the shopping cart that are out of stock or have insufficient quantity. You can configure it to handle the removal of out-of-stock items and provide a route to the cart page.

## OutOfStock configurations

The `OutOfStock` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['active', 'boolean', 'No', 'Activates/deactivates the container (default value is true).'],
    ['onCartProductsUpdate', 'function', 'No', 'Handles the removal of out-of-stock items. It takes the list of items that are out of stock as an argument.'],
    ['routeCart', 'function', 'No', 'The route to the cart page.'],
  ]}
/>

These configuration options implement the `OutOfStockProps` interface:

### OutOfStockProps interface

The `OutOfStock` container receives an object as a parameter which implements the `OutOfStockProps` interface with the following properties:

```ts
export type UpdateProductsFromCart = Array<{
  uid: string;
  quantity: number;
}>;

export interface OutOfStockProps extends Omit<HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>, 'icon'> {
  active?: boolean;
  onCartProductsUpdate?: (items: UpdateProductsFromCart) => void;
  routeCart?: () => string;
}
```

- Set the `active` property to _true_ to have the container in reactive mode (it is visible and responds to system events). If it is set to _false_, the container is deactivated (it does not subscribe to system events and is not rendered).
- The `onCartProductsUpdate` property is a handler used to perform actions called when there are out-of-stock items. It takes the list of items (array with pairs of _uid_ and _quantity_ values) as an input parameter.
- The `routeCart` property is a handler used to indicate the route to the cart page.

## Example

The following example renders the `OutOfStock` container to handle and display out-of-stock items in the cart:

```ts
import * as cartApi from '@dropins/storefront-cart/api.js';
import OutOfStock from '@dropins/storefront-checkout/containers/OutOfStock.js';
import { render as CheckoutProvider } from '@dropins/storefront-checkout/render.js';

const $outOfStock = checkoutFragment.querySelector('.checkout__out-of-stock');

CheckoutProvider.render(OutOfStock, {
  routeCart: () => '/cart',
  onCartProductsUpdate: (items) => {
    cartApi.updateProductsFromCart(items).catch(console.error);
  },
})($outOfStock),
```
