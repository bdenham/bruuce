import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `EstimateShipping` container is designed to estimate and display shipping costs during the checkout process.

This container is read-only, unlike the editable [`EstimateShipping`](/dropins/cart/containers/estimate-shipping/) container in the cart drop-in component. Initially, it displays estimated shipping costs. After a customer provides a shipping address and selects a shipping method, it shows the actual shipping cost. This container is designed to be used as a slot within the `OrderSummary` container from the cart, where the estimated shipping information is displayed.

## EstimateShipping configurations

The `EstimateShipping` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['active', 'boolean', 'No', 'Activates/deactivates the container (default value is true).'],
  ]}
/>

These configuration options implement the `EstimateShippingProps` interface:

### EstimateShippingProps interface

The `EstimateShipping` container receives an object as a parameter which implements the `EstimateShippingProps` interface with the following properties:

```ts
export interface EstimateShippingProps {
  active?: boolean;
}
```

<li>Set the `active` property to _true_ to have the container in reactive mode (it is visible and responds to system events). If it is set to _false_, the container is deactivated (it does not subscribe to system events and is not rendered).</li>

## Example

The following example renders an `OrderSummary` container within a checkout page and includes a slot for estimating shipping:

```ts
import OrderSummary from '@dropins/storefront-cart/containers/OrderSummary.js';
import { render as CartProvider } from '@dropins/storefront-cart/render.js';

import EstimateShipping from '@dropins/storefront-checkout/containers/EstimateShipping.js';
import { render as CheckoutProvider } from '@dropins/storefront-checkout/render.js';

const $orderSummary = checkoutFragment.querySelector(
  '.checkout__order-summary',
);

CartProvider.render(OrderSummary, {
  slots: {
    EstimateShipping: (esCtx) => {
      const estimateShippingForm = document.createElement('div');
      CheckoutProvider.render(EstimateShipping)(estimateShippingForm);
      esCtx.appendChild(estimateShippingForm);
    },
  },
})($orderSummary),
```
