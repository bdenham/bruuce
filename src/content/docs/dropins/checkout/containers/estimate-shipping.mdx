import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `EstimateShipping` container is designed to estimate and display shipping costs during the checkout process.

## EstimateShipping configurations

The `EstimateShipping` container is read-only, unlike the editable [`EstimateShipping`](/dropins/cart/cart-slots/#estimate-shipping) container in the Cart dropin. Initially, it displays estimated shipping costs. After a customer provides a shipping address and selects a shipping method, it shows the actual shipping cost. This container is designed to be used as a slot within the `OrderSummary` container from the Cart dropin, where the estimated shipping information is displayed.

## Example

The following example renders an `OrderSummary` container within a checkout page and includes a slot for estimating shipping:

```ts
import { OrderSummary } from '@dropins/storefront-cart/containers/OrderSummary.js';
import { render as CartProvider } from '@dropins/storefront-cart/render.js';

const $orderSummary = checkoutFragment.querySelector(
  '.checkout__order-summary'
);

CartProvider.render(OrderSummary, {
  slots: {
    EstimateShipping: (esCtx) => {
      const estimateShippingForm = document.createElement('div');
      CheckoutProvider.render(EstimateShipping)(estimateShippingForm);
      esCtx.appendChild(estimateShippingForm);
    },
  },
})($orderSummary),
```
