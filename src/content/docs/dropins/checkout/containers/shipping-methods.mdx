description: Configure the ShippingMethods container to manage and display available shipping methods during checkout.

import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `ShippingMethods` is a _conditional_ container. It is designed to manage and display the selection of available shipping methods during the checkout process. You can configure it to handle the selection of shipping methods, display the available shipping methods, and manage the main slot for the shipping methods.

## ShippingMethods configurations

The `ShippingMethods` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['hideOnEmptyCart (*)', 'boolean', 'No', 'Hides the container if the cart is empty (default value is true).'],
    ['hideOnVirtualCart (*)', 'boolean', 'No', 'Hides the container if the cart is virtual (default value is false).'],
    ['displayTitle (**)', 'boolean', 'No', 'Displays the container title (default value is true).'],
    ['onShippingMethodSelect', 'function', 'No', 'A function that takes a ShippingMethod object as an argument. It is called when a shipping method is selected.'],
    ['preSelectedMethod', 'object', 'No', 'Object containing carrierCode and methodCode strings. It represents the pre-selected shipping method.'],
    ['slots (**)', 'object', 'No', 'Object with the title to be displayed on the ShippingMethods container.'],
  ]}
/>

(*) Properties inherited from `ConditionalContainer`

(**) Properties inherited from `TitleProps`

These configuration options are implementing the `ShippingMethodsProps` interface:

### ShippingMethodsProps interface

The `ShippingMethods` container receives an object as a parameter which implements the `ShippingMethodsProps` interface with the following properties:

```ts
export interface ShippingMethodsProps extends HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>, TitleProps {
  onShippingMethodSelect?: (method: ShippingMethod) => void;
  preSelectedMethod?: { carrierCode: string; methodCode: string };
}
```

<li>The `onShippingMethodSelect` property is a handler used to perform actions called when a shipping method is selected.</li>

<li>The `preSelectedMethod` property is an object containing the pair of _carrierCode_ and _methodCode_ values which defines the pre-selected shipping method to show.</li>

## Example

The following example renders the `ShippingMethods` container on a checkout page. It includes configurations to hide the component for virtual carts, pre-selecting the free shipping in case no shipping method is selected, and showing a message in case the chosen shipping method is `Best Way` (Table Rate).

```ts
import ShippingMethods from '@dropins/storefront-checkout/containers/ShippingMethods.js';
import { render as CheckoutProvider } from '@dropins/storefront-checkout/render.js';

const $delivery = checkoutFragment.querySelector('.checkout__delivery');

CheckoutProvider.render(ShippingMethods, {
  hideOnVirtualCart: true,
  preSelectedMethod: { carrierCode: 'freeshipping', methodCode: 'freeshipping' },
  onShippingMethodSelect: (method) => {
    if (method.carrier.code === 'tablerate' && method.code === 'bestway') {
      const shippingMsg = document.createElement('div');
      shippingMsg.innerText = 'Shipping method not available for Canary Islands';
      $delivery.appendChild(shippingMsg);
    }
  },
})($delivery),
```
