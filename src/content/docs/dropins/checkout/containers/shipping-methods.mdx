import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `ShippingMethods` container is designed to manage and display the selection of available shipping methods during the checkout process. You can configure it to handle the selection of shipping methods, display the available shipping methods, and manage the main slot for the shipping methods.

This container contains internal functionality to hide itself in case the cart is empty or virtual.

## ShippingMethods configurations

The `ShippingMethods` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['displayTitle (*)', 'boolean', 'No', 'Displays the container title (default value is true).'],
    ['onShippingMethodSelect', 'function', 'No', 'A function that takes a ShippingMethod object as an argument. It is called when a shipping method is selected.'],
    ['preSelectedMethod', 'object', 'No', 'Object containing carrierCode and methodCode strings. It represents the pre-selected shipping method.'],
    ['slots (*)', 'object', 'No', 'Object with the title to be displayed on the ShippingMethods container.'],
    ['UIComponentType', 'string', 'No', 'String with the UI component type to be used as selector (default value is \'RadioButton\').'],
  ]}
/>

(*) Properties inherited from `TitleProps`

These configuration options are implementing the `ShippingMethodsProps` interface:

### ShippingMethodsProps interface

The `ShippingMethods` container receives an object as a parameter which implements the `ShippingMethodsProps` interface with the following properties:

```ts
export interface ShippingMethodsProps extends HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>, TitleProps {
  onShippingMethodSelect?: (method: ShippingMethod) => void;
  preSelectedMethod?: { carrierCode: string; methodCode: string };
  UIComponentType?: UIComponentType;
}
```

<li>The `displayTitle (*)` property is inherited from `TitleProps` interface; this is used to decide whether the title is displayed or not.</li>

<li>The `onShippingMethodSelect` property is a handler used to perform actions called when a shipping method is selected.</li>

<li>The `preSelectedMethod` property is an object containing the pair of _carrierCode_ and _methodCode_ values which defines the pre-selected shipping method to show.</li>

<li>The `UIComponentType` property is a string containing the name of the UI component type to be used as a selector for each shipping method. The UI components available are: 'ToggleButton' or 'RadioButton'.</li>

<li>The `slots (*)` property is inherited from the `TitleProps` interface. It is an object that containing the following properties:</li>

#### Title property (*)

The `Title` property is a handler used to render a custom title content.

## Example

The following example renders the `ShippingMethods` container on a checkout page. It includes configurations to hide the title, pre-select the free shipping option if no shipping method is selected, and show a message if the chosen shipping method is `Best Way` (Table Rate).

```ts
import ShippingMethods from '@dropins/storefront-checkout/containers/ShippingMethods.js';
import { render as CheckoutProvider } from '@dropins/storefront-checkout/render.js';

const $delivery = checkoutFragment.querySelector('.checkout__delivery');

CheckoutProvider.render(ShippingMethods, {
  displayTitle: false,
  preSelectedMethod: { carrierCode: 'freeshipping', methodCode: 'freeshipping' },
  onShippingMethodSelect: (method) => {
    if (method.carrier.code === 'tablerate' && method.code === 'bestway') {
      const shippingMsg = document.createElement('div');
      shippingMsg.innerText = 'Shipping method not available for Canary Islands';
      $delivery.appendChild(shippingMsg);
    }
  },
})($delivery),
```
