The `PlaceOrder` container is designed to handle the final step in the checkout process, where the user confirms and places their order. You can configure it to handle the place order action, disable the place order button, and manage the main slot for the place order button.

## PlaceOrder configurations

The `PlaceOrder` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['onPlaceOrder', 'function', 'No', 'Handles the place order action. It takes a PlaceOrderContext object as an argument and returns a Promise<void>.'],
    ['disabled', 'boolean', 'No', 'Indicates whether the place order button is disabled.']
  ]}
/>
