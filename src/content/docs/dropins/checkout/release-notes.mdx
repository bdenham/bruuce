## v1.1.0
_February ??, 2025_

**[Improvement]** `PaymentMethods` Container configuration structure has been modified; the `PaymentMethodsProps` interface has been changed and some properties have been _deprecated_ replaced by new ones:

<Callouts columnCount="1">

1. **PaymentMethodsProps.setOnChange property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following one: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.setOnChange`.
1. **PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Handlers property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following one: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.render`.
1. **PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods property added**: This property is an object which consists on a list of payment method codes providing a set of configurations to customize each payment method individually.
1. **Configurations accepted by payment methods:**
    - The `displayLabel` configuration hides the payment method label (for instance, if you only want to display the icon).
    - The `enabled` configuration allows merchants to individually hide payment methods filtering them from the available payment methods list (for instance, it is useful when a payment provider has enabled a payment method in the backend, which is configured with more than one payment option and you don't want to display one of them).
    - The `icon` configuration specifies the name of the icon to be shown beside of the label. The icon name must exist within the list of available icons defined on [Elsie](https://elsie.dev/docs/?path=/story/components-icon--all-icons).
    - The `setOnChange` configuration sets the payment method automatically when it is selected. Only if a payment method is specifically set to _false_, the container will not automatically set the payment method to the cart when selected (for instance, if a payment method needs more information obtained during the place order action).
    - The `render` configuration is a handler used to render and configure the payment method.
