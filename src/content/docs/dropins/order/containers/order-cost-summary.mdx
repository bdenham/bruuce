The `OrderCostSummary` container is used on Order Details and Return Details pages to display a breakdown of order costs. It includes the following sections:

- **Subtotal**: Displays the total cost of all items in the order before applying discounts, taxes, or additional charges.
- **Shipping**: Displays the shipping cost, which depends on the shipping method, location, and weight of the order.
- **Discount**: Displays any applicable discounts, such as promotional or volume-based offers, subtracted from the subtotal.
- **Coupon**: Displays the value of any applied coupons and their impact on the final cost.
- **Tax**: Displays the tax amount added to the order, calculated based on jurisdiction and item type.
- **Total**: Displays the final payable amount, including all adjustments such as discounts, shipping, and taxes.

If a value is not provided for any section (such as no discount or coupons are applied), the corresponding line is hidden. This ensures the container only displays relevant information.

The display of tax amounts is configured at **Stores** > Configuration > **Sales** > **Tax** > **Order, Invoices, Credit Memos Display Settings**.
