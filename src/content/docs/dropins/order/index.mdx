The order drop-in component provides a comprehensive set of tools and containers designed to manage and display order-related data across various pages and scenarios. It simplifies the implementation of order management functionality and supports seamless integration with both customer accounts and guest user workflows.

## Architecture

The order drop-in component consists of multiple containers that display order details on different pages, such as:

- Order data containers display order details within the customer account, guest user areas, and on the order confirmation page.
- Returned merchandise authorization (RMA) containers guide users through the return process and display a list of created return requests.
- The `OrderSearch` container enables guest users to locate their orders using a combination of email, ZIP code, and order number. This ensures easy access to order details even for users without an account. (Logged-in customers can also use this form.)

The component's initialization process helps manage data retrieval and event emission, ensuring that containers receive the necessary data without individual fetching.

This modular architecture allows for efficient, reusable, and highly customizable implementations of order and return workflows, making it ideal for both standard and advanced e-commerce use cases. In addition, the order/return details pages implementation includes elements like the headers, which are implemented at the boilerplate level rather than provided directly by the drop-in containers. These elements, including `commerce-order-header` and `commerce-return-header` blocks, are covered as part of the overall framework for order/return details layouts, but are distinct from the drop-in container set.

The following diagrams provide a visual composition of the order details and return details pages:
