import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `CreditCard` container allows a shopper to place an order with credit card details during the checkout process. You can configure it to manage and display the credit card fields.

## CreditCard configurations

The `CreditCard` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['apiUrl', 'string', 'Yes', 'The URL to the Adobe Commerce GraphQL endpoint, such as "https://example.com/graphql".'],
    ['getCartId', 'function', 'Yes', 'Should return a promise that resolves to the shopper`s cart ID.'],
    ['getCustomerToken', 'function', 'Yes', 'The credit card container may send GraphQL requests on behalf of the shopper. This requires GraphQL authorization, which can be performed using authorization tokens or session cookies. For token-based authorization, the "getCustomerToken" function should return a customer token as a string or null for guest checkouts. For session-based authorization, the "getCustomerToken" property must explicitly be set to "null".'],
    ['creditCardFormRef', 'object', 'Yes', 'Credit card form reference. Initially, { current: null } should be passed. Once rendered, the credit card container will set the "current" property to an { validate: () => boolean; submit: () => Promise<void> } object, which parent containers can use to (programmatically) validate and submit the credit card form.'],
    ['onSuccess', 'function', 'No', 'Called when payment flow finishes successfully. This function is not passed any arguments.'],
    ['onError', 'function', 'No', 'Called when the payment flow was aborted due to an error. The function receives a single argument, {message: string}, containing the reason of error.'],
  ]}
/>

## Example

The following example renders the `CreditCard` container to handle and display the available credit card fields as a payment method.

```js
import CreditCard, { CREDIT_CARD_CODE } from '@dropins/payment-services/containers/CreditCard.js';
import { render as PaymentServicesProvider } from '@dropins/payment-services/render.js';
import { getConfigValue } from '../../scripts/configs.js';
import { getUserTokenCookie } from '../../scripts/initializers/index.js';

const apiUrl = await getConfigValue('commerce-core-endpoint');
const container = document.createElement('div');
const placeOrderButton = document.getElementById('place-order');
const getCartId = () => 'ozGi7uLI74etDYyMijoI2cla5CmGIBch';

PaymentServicesProvider.render(CreditCard, {
  apiUrl: apiUrl,
  getCustomerToken: getUserTokenCookie,
  getCartId: getCartId,
  onRender: (creditCardForm) => {
    placeOrderButton.onclick = async () => {
      await creditCardForm.submit();
    };
  },
})(container);
```
