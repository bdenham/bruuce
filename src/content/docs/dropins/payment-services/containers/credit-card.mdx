import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `CreditCard` container is designed to allow placing an order with credit card details during the checkout process. You can configure it to manage and display the available credit card fields for a payment method.

## CreditCard configurations

The `CreditCard` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['apiUrl', 'string', 'Yes', 'Adobe Commerce GraphQL API URL, e.g., "https://magento.test/graphql".'],
    ['getCartId', 'function', 'Yes', 'Should return a promise that resolves to the cart id for which to make a payment.'],
    ['getCustomerToken', 'function', 'No', 'The Credit Card container may send GraphQL requests on behalf of the customer. This requires GraphQL Authorization, which can be done in two ways: (1) Authorization tokens; (2) Session cookies. For token-based authorization, one must provide a "getCustomerToken" function that should return a customer token as a string or null for guest checkouts.'],
    ['onSuccess', 'function', 'No', 'Called when payment flow finishes successfully. This function is not passed any arguments.'],
    ['onError', 'function', 'Called when the payment flow was aborted due to an error. The function receives a single argument, {message: string}, containing the reason of error.'],
    ['onRender', 'function', 'Called when the credit card fields render successfully. The function receives the credit card instance as its single argument, which has a submit() method to be used to start the payment flow.'],
    ['onValidation', 'function', 'Called when the credit card form validity changes. Use this, for example, to disable/enable a "Place order" button.'],
  ]}
/>

## Example

The following example renders the `CreditCard` container to handle and display the available credit card fields as a payment method.

```js
import CreditCard, { CREDIT_CARD_CODE } from '@dropins/payment-services/containers/CreditCard.js';
import { render as PaymentServicesProvider } from '@dropins/payment-services/render.js';
import { getConfigValue } from '../../scripts/configs.js';
import { getUserTokenCookie } from '../../scripts/initializers/index.js';

const apiUrl = await getConfigValue('commerce-core-endpoint');
const container = document.createElement('div');
const placeOrderButton = document.getElementById('place-order');
const getCartId = () => 'ozGi7uLI74etDYyMijoI2cla5CmGIBch';

PaymentServicesProvider.render(CreditCard, {
  apiUrl: apiUrl,
  getCustomerToken: getUserTokenCookie,
  getCartId: getCartId,
  onRender: (creditCardForm) => {
    placeOrderButton.onclick = async () => {
      await creditCardForm.submit();
    };
  },
})(container);
```
