Before you can use the Payment Services component on your storefront, you must [configure the Services Connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-learn/tutorials/admin/adobe-commerce-services/configure-adobe-commerce-services-connector) and [onboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/payment-services/get-started/onboard) the Payment Services extension in the Adobe Commerce Admin.

:::note
The Payment Services drop-in component requires the [Payment Services extension](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/payment-services/release-notes#v2100) version 2.10.0 or newer.

## Installation

The Payment Services component relies on containers from several other drop-in components, you must install and configure those components before you can use the Payment Services component to place an order.

The [Commerce boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce) includes all of the necessary drop-in components and configurations to help you get started quickly, so Adobe recommends relying on the boilerplate instead of installing, configuring, and integrating the drop-in components individually.
