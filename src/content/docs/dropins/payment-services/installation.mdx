The Payment Services drop-in component provides a customizable UI for the checkout process. The checkout compoennt is designed to be integrated into a your storefront and provides a seamless checkout experience for customers.

## Installation

The Payment Services component relies on containers from several other drop-in components, you must install and configure those components before you can use the Payment Services component to place an order.

The [Commerce boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce) includes all of the necessary drop-in components and configurations to help you get started quickly, so Adobe recommends relying on the boilerplate instead of installing, configuring, and integrating the drop-in components individually.

## Admin configuration

Before you can use the Payment Services component on your storefront, you must [enable](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas) and [configure the Services Connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-learn/tutorials/admin/adobe-commerce-services/configure-adobe-commerce-services-connector) in the Adobe Commerce Admin.
