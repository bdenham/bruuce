import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Wishlist drop-in component provides both guests and registered customers with a mechanism to store products they are interested in purchasing later.
The `Wishlist` component is fully customizable and can be integrated into your storefront to enhance the shopping experience.

## Use cases

The `Wishlist` drop-in component offers a variety of fully-customizable controls to highlight your products (according to your brand's aesthetics) and create interactive experiences.
Use cases include:

- **Buy it later**: A user finds an interesting product and wants to keep it in a place where they can quickly purchase it later.
