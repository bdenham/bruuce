The wishlist drop-in component provides both guests and registered customers with a mechanism to store products they are interested in purchasing later.

The wishlist component is fully customizable and can be integrated into your storefront to enhance the shopping experience.

## Use cases

The wishlist drop-in component offers a variety of fully-customizable controls to highlight your products (according to your brand's aesthetics) and create interactive experiences. Use cases include:

- **Buy it later**: Users can save products they find interesting to a dedicated location for quick access when they are ready to make a purchase.
