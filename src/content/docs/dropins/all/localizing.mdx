In our global economy, localization is crucial. And it's one of the easiest changes to make. This page shows how to add a second language file and use it in your storefront.

## Big picture

The following diagram shows the process for adding and overriding labels and text for drop-in components within the boilerplate template.

## Vocabulary

<Vocabulary>

### Dictionaries

JSON files that define the shape, keys, and default values for labels and text within a drop-in component. Each drop-in component has a default dictionary file: `en_US.json`. But drop-in components can contain multiple dictionary files as the site is localized for other languages, including `fr_CA.json` for French, `de_DE.json` for German, and so on.

### Language code

A two-letter code that identifies a language. For example, `en` for English, `fr` for French, and `de` for German.

### Language files

See dictionaries.

### Locale

A combination of a language code and a country code. For example, `en_US` for English in the United States, `fr_CA` for French in Canada, and `de_DE` for German in Germany.

### Localization

The process of adapting a product or service to a particular language.

### Placeholders

A Google Sheets file (`placeholders`) or a SharePoint Excel file (`placeholders.xlsx`) where you enter your site's text variables, which includes localization. The file has two columns: a _Key column_ that contains the variables in your site's code and a _Text column_ that contains the text values that will replace those variables at runtime. See [placeholders](https://www.aem.live/docs/placeholders) in the Edge Delivery Services documentation for more information.

## Common drop-in component dictionary

The following code block shows the default dictionary file for all drop-in components. This file contains the default values for all labels and text common to all drop-in components.

## How to override drop-in component dictionaries

To override the default dictionary values, you can create a new dictionary in the boilerplate's `product-details.js` file and assign it to the drop-in component's `langDefinitions` constant. The new dictionary file should contain only the keys and values you want to override in the default dictionary.

For example, to override the default value of the `AddToCart` key, you can create a new dictionary in your `product-details.js` file like this:

This will override the default value of the `AddToCart` key with the new value `Add to Bag`.
