In our global economy, localization is crucial. And it's one of the easiest changes to make. This page shows how to add a second language file and use it in your storefront.

## Big picture

The following diagram shows the process for adding and overriding labels and text for drop-in components within the boilerplate template.

1. **Placeholder files**. Merchants can quickly update the labels in their storefront from one file: `placeholders`, which is either a Google Sheet or Microsoft Excel file.
1. **Import functions**. The functions you need to fetch the key-value pairs from the placeholder file are in the boilerplate's `aem.js` file. This step simply highlights the need to import the `fetchPlaceholders` function from the `aem.js` file.
1. **Fetch placeholders.** Use the `fetchPlaceholders` function to retrieve the `placeholder` file key-value pairs from Google Docs or SharePoint folders.
1. **Map placeholder keys**. Now you need to map the `placeholder` file keys to the drop-in component's default dictionary, located in the drop-in component's.
1. **Override dictionary**. Use the `initializers.register` API to override the drop-in component's default dictionary.

## Vocabulary

<Vocabulary>

### Dictionaries

JSON files that define the shape, keys, and default values for labels and text within a drop-in component. Each drop-in component has a default dictionary file: `en_US.json`. But drop-in components can contain multiple dictionary files as the site is localized for other languages, including `fr_CA.json` for French, `de_DE.json` for German, and so on.

### Language code

A two-letter code that identifies a language. For example, `en` for English, `fr` for French, and `de` for German.

### Language files

See dictionaries.

### Locale

A combination of a language code and a country code. For example, `en_US` for English in the United States, `fr_CA` for French in Canada, and `de_DE` for German in Germany.

### Localization

The process of adapting a product or service to a particular language.

### Placeholders

A Google Sheets file (`placeholders`) or a SharePoint Excel file (`placeholders.xlsx`) where you change and maintain your storefront's labels, which includes localization.

## Common drop-in component dictionary

The following code block shows the default dictionary file for all drop-in components. This file contains the default values for all labels and text common to all drop-in components.

## How to relabel and localize drop-in components

In the boilerplate code, most of the text labels displayed by drop-in components come from a content file called `placeholders`. This file is a Google Sheet (if your content is in Google Docs) or an Excel file (if your content is in SharePoint). Using this file as the source for all storefront labels across drop-in components makes it easy for merchants to make simple label changes without developer involvement.

### Placeholders file

To override the default dictionary values, you can create a new dictionary in the boilerplate's `product-details.js` file and assign it to the drop-in component's `langDefinitions` constant. The new dictionary file should contain only the keys and values you want to override in the default dictionary.

For example, to override the default value of the `AddToCart` key, you can create a new dictionary in your `product-details.js` file like this:

This will override the default value of the `AddToCart` key with the new value `Add to Bag`.
