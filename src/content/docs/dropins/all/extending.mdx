Using slots provides the deepest level of customization. Slots are built-in extension points in the drop-in. A slot provides a place in the drop-in component to add your own UI components and functions. This architecture makes it easy to change the default look, layout, and behavior. Let's learn how it works.

## Big Picture

1. `prependSibling`: A function to prepend a new HTML element before the slot's content.
1. `prependChild`: A function to prepend a new HTML element to the slot's content.
1. `replaceWith`: A function to replace the slot's content with a new HTML element.
1. `appendChild`: A function to append a new HTML element to the slot's content.
1. `appendSibling`: A function to append a new HTML element after the slot's content.
1. `getSlotElement`: A function to get a slot element.
1. `onChange`: A function to listen to changes in the slot's context.
1. `dictionary`: JSON Object for the current locale. If the locale changes, the `dictionary` values change to reflect the values for the selected language.

## Vocabulary

<Vocabulary>

### Container

Component that manages or encapsulates other components. Containers handle logic, fetch data, manage state, and pass data to the UI components that are rendered on the screen.

### Slot

Component that provides placeholders to add other components. You can use a drop-in component's built-in slots to add or remove UI components and functions. Or you can add your own additional Slots.

### Component

Overloaded term in web development. Everything is a component. It's components all the way down. This is why we need to be specific about what kind of component we are talking about. For example, from top-to-bottom, big-to-small, a **drop-in component** can contain multiple **container components** that can contain multiple **slot components** that can contain multiple **UI components**.

## Add third-party components

This tutorial describes the steps needed to integrate a third-party component (the Yotpo ratings & reviews component) within the product detail drop-in. We will add one component instance below the product's title (under the title slot), and a second instance below the product gallery.

:::note[Performance]
Be vigilant about how you display and fetch data for your 3rd-party component because these things can slow performance, especially Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
:::

### Prerequisites

- Third-party component API key — you'll need this to fetch rating data.
- Config file — a spreadsheet that stores your API key for easy reference.
- EventBus import — to emit a ratings event and listen for it in the code.

### What you'll learn

In this guide, we'll show you how to:

- Configure API keys for 3rd-party components (Yotpo ratings & reviews)
- Emit and listen for ratings events for the stars under the product title
- Delay loading the full reviews to improve page performance

### Step-by-step

<Tasks>

<Task>
### Add the API key to your config files

The boilerplate starter code contains three config files, one for each environment: `configs.xlsx` (prod), `configs-stage.xlsx` and `configs-dev.xlsx` (or the equivalent Google sheets files). Add your 3rd-party API key to the config environments you want to test or develop against. For example, if you're working in the dev environment, add the key to `configs-dev.xlsx` (or the equivalent Google sheet).

| Key                      | Value                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| yotpo-api-key            | \<3RD-PARTY_KEY_VALUE\>    |

Replace `yotpo-api-key` and `<3RD-PARTY_KEY_VALUE>` with the actual API key name and value.

</Task>

<Task>
### Fetch the component data

After the page loads, your 3rd-party component will likely need to fetch some data. In our case, the ratings component needs to fetch data from Yotpo to display the star-rating for the product. Once the API key is set, you can trigger a call to the Yotpo endpoint.

Below is a sample fetch call. Adjust it to match your environment:

```js
function setRatingsJson(product, yotpoApiKey) {
  try {
    fetch(`https://api.yotpo.com/products/${yotpoApiKey}/${product.externalId}/bottomline`).then(e => e.ok ? e.json() : {}).then(body => {
      const { average_score, total_reviews } = body?.response?.bottomline || {};
      setHtmlProductJsonLd({
        aggregateRating: {
          '@type': 'AggregateRating',
          ratingValue: average_score || 0,
          reviewCount: total_reviews || 0,
        }
      });

      events.emit('eds/pdp/ratings', {average: average_score, total: total_reviews});
    });
} catch (error) {
    console.log(`Error fetching product ratings: ${error}`);
    setHtmlProductJsonLd({
      aggregateRating: {
        '@type': 'AggregateRating',
        ratingValue: 0,
        reviewCount: 0,
      }
    });

    events.emit('eds/pdp/ratings', {average: 0, total: 0});
  }
}
```

</Task>

<Task>
### Render the star rating (Title slot)

Star ratings appearing right under the product title can cause unwanted CLS if not planned carefully. To mitigate CLS, reserve space for the star rating element or render it after the reviews are fetched.

To listen for the event you just emitted, add an event listener for the 3rd-party component's event. Here's an example implementation for the ratings component:

```js
events.on('eds/pdp/ratings', ({ average, total }) => {
  // Title slot logic
  const titleSlotElement = document.querySelector('.title-slot');

  // Optionally reserve space for the star rating to avoid CLS
  // e.g., setting a placeholder element or CSS min-height

  // Render stars
  titleSlotElement.innerHTML = `
    <div class="star-rating">
      <span>Average Rating: ${average.toFixed(1)}</span>
      <span>(${total} reviews)</span>
    </div>
  `;
});
```
</Task>

<Task>
### Delay loading large data payloads from the 3rd-party component

In our example, The ratings & reviews component can load large amounts of data when displaying reviews. The reviews that show below the gallery are often large blocks of text or user-generated content that you need to load later, which helps:

- Improve First Contentful Paint (FCP) performance because you won't fetch the data until needed.
- Minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by loading the content in a reserved space or after user interaction.

#### Example implementation:

```js
// Trigger the delayed load when the user scrolls near the reviews section or clicks "View All Reviews"
const reviewsSection = document.getElementById('reviews-section');

const loadReviews = () => {
  // Fetch or render the full reviews only when needed
  fetch(`/path/to/full-reviews?apiKey=${YOUR_API_KEY}&productId=${PRODUCT_ID}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      reviewsSection.innerHTML = data.reviewsHtml;
    })
    .catch(console.error);
};

// Event listener approach for a "View All Reviews" button
document.getElementById('view-reviews-btn').addEventListener('click', loadReviews);

// OR intersection observer approach to load when user scrolls near the section
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      loadReviews();
      observer.disconnect();
    }
  });
}, { threshold: 0.1 });

observer.observe(reviewsSection);
```
