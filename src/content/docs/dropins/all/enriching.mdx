This topic introduces you to the concept of enriching commerce blocks in the commerce boilerplate. You will learn how to add content blocks above or below a commerce block (or any other block). You will also learn how to add content to slots in a drop-in component using the slots API functions.

## Big picture

Drop-in components can be enriched in the following ways:

<Callouts columnCount="1">

1. **Add content blocks**: Add new content blocks above or below the commerce block in the Word or Google document.
1. **Add enrichment blocks**: Add an enrichment block below the commerce block in the Word or Google document.
1. **Add content to slots**: Add content above or below slots in the drop-in component using the slots API functions.

## Key concepts

<Vocabulary>

### Enrichment

Enrichment means to add content that strengthens the user experience of the drop-in on the webpage. When viewing a product's details (via the product-details drop-in), the user experiences all the core features of the drop-in. However, all the other extra content on the page, like product recommendations, must be added in one of the ways described in this topic.

### Content blocks

Content blocks are tables in a document that contain text, images, or other media. They are used to structure and organize content on a webpage. See <Link href="https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection" text="Block collection" /> for more information.

### Commerce blocks

Commerce blocks are Edge Delivery Service blocks that contain drop-in components. Commerce blocks are used to add drop-in components like the PDP drop-in, as well as custom components like product recommendations and other commerce-related information on a webpage.


### Enrichment blocks

Enrichment blocks are specialized content blocks to dynamically display content above or below commerce blocks based on various conditions, including but not limited to product SKUs and category numbers.

### Content positioning

Content positioning is the placement of content and enrichment blocks on a webpage. It includes the arrangement of content blocks above or below a commerce blocks. Positioning content inside a drop-in component is also possible using the slot API functions. The webpage structure is within a Word or Google docs file. This file includes tables that define content blocks, commerce blocks, and other HTML elements.

### Slot API functions

The slots API provides several functions to add content within a drop-in component by specifying a slot name and a position. The slot API provides functions to add content to specific positions above and below the slot, such as prepend and append. See the full list of slot API functions here: [Understanding slots](/dropins/all/slots#big-picture)

## Add content blocks

The following steps show you how to enrich a commerce block by placing content blocks above or below it. The following example shows the default product-details document with a simple product recommendation block below it.

<Tasks>

<Task>
### Open a commerce block document

Open the document that contains the commerce block you want to enrich. In the boilerplate starter content, open the `products/default.docx` to see an example of a product recommendation block below the product details block.

</Task>

<Task>
### Add normal content or content blocks

Add a normal headings, text, images or content blocks above or below the commerce block in the document. You can copy content blocks (tables) from the [AEM Sidekick Library](https://sidekick-library--aem-block-collection--adobe.aem.page/tools/sidekick/library.html?plugin=blocks&path=/block-collection/) and paste them into the document.

<Task>
### Preview and publish changes

Use AEM Sidekick to preview and publish the changes to see the content above or below the commerce block.

</Task>

</Tasks>

## Add enrichment blocks

Enrichment blocks are used to add content above or below commerce blocks based on product and category numbers. The following steps show you how to enrich a commerce block by placing an enrichment block above or below it.

<Task>
### Create enrichment content

In Google Docs or SharePoint, add a new document to the `enrichment` folder. You can duplicate the `product-banner` document and rename it. Then add the content you want to display below the commerce block. For example, you can show a sale on watches for a specific product SKU as shown here:

<Task>
### Change the metadata values

Change the metadata values for the enrichment content to match the product SKUs or product categories for which you want your content to appear.

</Task>

<Task>
### Preview and publish changes

Use AEM Sidekick to preview and publish the changes to see the content above or below the commerce block.

</Task>

</Tasks>

## Add content to slots

The following steps show you how to enrich a commerce block drop-in by using the slots API functions to add content inside the drop-in component of a commerce block.

<Tasks>

<Task>
### Open the commerce block JavaScript file

In your storefront's GitHub project, open the JavaScript file for the commerce block's drop-in component you want to change. For example, open the `product-details.js` file in the `blocks/product-details` folder.

</Task>

<Task>
### Add content using the slots API functions

The slots for product details are defined in the `ProductDetailsProps` interface. Each slot comes with a set of [primitive functions](/dropins/all/extending/) you can use to add content programmatically. For example, you can add a decoration to the product title and a ratings element using the `Title` slot as shown here:


```js
return productRenderer.render(ProductDetails, {
  sku: getSkuFromUrl(),
  slots: {
    Title: (ctx) => {
      // title decoration
      const tagline = document.createElement('div');
      tagline.classList.add('title-decoration');
      tagline.innerHTML = 'WKND Essentials';
      ctx.prependSibling(tagline);

      const rating = document.createElement('div');
      rating.classList.add('ratings');
      rating.innerHTML = '⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️';
      ctx.appendSibling(rating);
    },
  },
});
```

## Summary

In this topic, you learned how to enrich drop-in components by adding content blocks above or below commerce blocks (powered by drop-in components) in a content document, adding enrichment blocks to commerce blocks, and adding content to slots using the slots API functions. You can now enrich your drop-in components with additional content to enhance the user experience on your webpage.
