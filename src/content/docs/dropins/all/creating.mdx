This topic describes how to use the `drop-template` repository to create drop-in components for Adobe Commerce Storefronts.

## What are drop-in component templates?
Drop-in templates are GitHub Templates that allow you to quickly create drop-in components with the same structure, branches, files, and best practices built in. The `dropin-template` repository provides the starting point for creating new drop-ins quickly and consistently.

For more information on GitHub Templates, you can refer to the following resource: [How to Use GitHub Repository Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

## How to use the Adobe Commerce drop-in template
:::note
Supported Node versions are: Maintenance (v20) and Active (v22).
:::

To create a new drop-in component using the Adobe Commerce drop-in template, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. **Navigate to the Template Repository**: Go to https://github.com/adobe-commerce/dropin-template.
1. **Create a New Repository**: Click on the **Use this template** button to create a new repository based on the template. This will generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as the template.
1. **Clone Your New Repository**: You can now clone the newly created repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
1. **Getting Started**: Follow the instructions below to install the dependencies, generate a configuration file, update your Mesh endpoint, generate your source files, and launch your development environment.
</Steps>

**Troubleshooting:**  
- If you don't see the **Use this template** button, make sure you are logged into GitHub.
- If you get a "Permission denied" error, check your SSH keys or use HTTPS.

## Getting started
<Tasks>
<Task>

### Install dependencies
Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Run the following command to install all required packages:
```bash
npm install
```
**Troubleshooting:**  
If you see errors about missing Node.js, install it from <ExternalLink href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</ExternalLink>.
</Task>

<Task>
### Generate new config
Before you can start developing, you need to generate the `.elsie.js` config file. The Elsie CLI uses this file to generate new components, containers, and API functions in specified directories within your project.
To create a new configuration file, run the following command. Replace `<DropInName>` with the name of your new drop-in.

```bash
npx elsie generate config --name <DropInName>
```

After generating the `.elsie.js` config, open it and take a look. Below is an annotated version describing the main properties:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: 'Login', // The name of your frontend. This name can be changed at any time.
  api: {
    root: './src/api', // Directory where the CLI will add all your generated API functions.
    importAliasRoot: '@/login/api',
  },
  components: [
    {
      id: 'Components',
      root: './src/components', // Directory where the CLI will add all your generated components.
      importAliasRoot: '@/login/components',
      cssPrefix: 'elsie',
      default: true,
    },
  ],
  containers: {
    root: './src/containers', // Directory where the CLI will add all your generated containers.
    importAliasRoot: '@/login/containers',
  },
};
```

**Troubleshooting:**  
If `npx` is not found, ensure Node.js and npm are installed.

</FileTree>

</Task>

<Task>

### Update mesh/backend endpoint (for development only)
For development purposes, you will need to rename your `.env.sample` file to `.env` and update the new `.env` file with the correct mesh/backend endpoint. This file is used to store environment-specific configurations.
```env
ENDPOINT="your-endpoint"
```
**Troubleshooting:**  
If you see network errors when running the dev server, check your endpoint URL.
</Task>

<Task>

### Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Congratulations! You just launched your frontend development environment. It's a preconfigured HTML page (`examples > html-host > index.html`) that loads your frontend components for testing during development:

<Diagram caption="Frontend development environment">
  ![Frontend Development Environment](src/content/docs/sdk/images/frontend.png)
</Diagram>

Now you're ready to start building a composable frontend. Stop the server with `Ctrl + C` and let's get started.

</Task>

<Task>
### Generate a new UI component
UI components in this codebase are primarily responsible for rendering the UI, handling presentation, and managing styling. To generate a new UI component, use the following command. Replace `<MyUIComponent>` with the name of your component.

```bash
npx elsie generate component --pathname <MyUIComponent>
```
**Make sure to use Pascal casing for the component name.**

For a login form, you might choose:

```bash
npx elsie generate component --pathname LoginForm
```

Let's take a quick look at the files that are generated for you:

```console
~/composable-login [main] » npx elsie generate component --pathname LoginForm
🆕 src/components/LoginForm/LoginForm.css created
🆕 src/components/LoginForm/LoginForm.stories.tsx created
🆕 src/components/LoginForm/LoginForm.test.tsx created
🆕 src/components/LoginForm/LoginForm.tsx created
🆕 src/components/LoginForm/index.ts created
🆕 src/components/index.ts created
~/composable-login [main] »
```

These files were not only generated with the appropriate names, but they are completely preconfigured to work together as a unit. For example, the `LoginForm` component was automatically imported into `src/components/index.ts` to let you start referencing the component throughout your project.

And if you run `npm run dev` again, you'll see your new component in the Storybook UI, configured with an example and best practices to help you get started with Storybook.

</Task>

<Task>
### Generate a new frontend container
Containers handle business logic, state management, API calls, and data fetching using the components. They do not contain CSS or styling logic.
To create a new frontend container, use this command. Replace `<MyContainer>` with the desired name of your frontend container. 

**Make sure to use Pascal casing for the container name.**

```bash
npx elsie generate container --pathname <MyContainer>
```
For a login form, you might choose:

```bash
npx elsie generate container --pathname LoginContainer
```
</Task>

<Task>
### Generate a new API function
The API layer provides core functionalities like fetching, handling events, and GraphQL operations. This API is primarily consumed by a container.

If you need to add a new API function, run the following command. Replace `<myApiFunction>` with the desired name for your API function. 

**Make sure to use camel casing for the API name.**

```bash
npx elsie generate api --pathname <myApiFunction>
```

For a login form, you might want to add `login` and `logout` functions as follows:

```bash
npx elsie generate api --pathname login
```

```bash
npx elsie generate api --pathname logout
```
</Task>

**Location:** 

Generated files will be placed in `src/components/`, `src/containers/`, and `src/api/` respectively

</Tasks>

## Adding a shared component to your project
After creating your drop-in component, let's add a shared component from the Storefront SDK. These components are designed to be reusable and customizable, making it easier to build consistent and high-quality user interfaces. Follow the steps below to add a shared component to your drop-in component project.

<Tasks>
<Task>

### Install the `@adobe-commerce/elsie` package
Run the following command to install the Storefront SDK package:

```bash
npm install @adobe-commerce/elsie
```
</Task>

<Task>

### Use a shared component from the SDK
In your generated UI component, import a shared component from the Storefront SDK package and render it. For example, you can add the `Button` component as follows:

   ```javascript
   import { Button } from '@adobe-commerce/elsie';
   
   function MyUiComponent() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Button label="Click Me" />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

</Task>

</Tasks>

## Development and testing
These development tools help you preview components during your development process and ensure that your code is properly tested.

### I. Run unit tests
The commands to generate a component, container or an API, also create a `.test.tsx` file in their respective directories. These files are useful for unit testing.

To ensure your code is working as expected, you should run these unit tests to catch any issues early in the development process:

```bash
npm run test
```

This project is set up to use the Jest testing framework. Here are some useful resources:

- [Jest Getting Started (official docs)](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [Preact Testing Library Intro](https://testing-library.com/docs/preact-testing-library/intro)

### II. Build production bundles
Once you're ready to prepare your app for production, run the following command to build the production bundles:

```bash
npm run build
```
A dist/ directory with production-ready assets will be created.

### III. Storybook
Storybook is a tool used for developing and testing UI components in isolation. Once a container/component is created using one of the commands above, a `.stories.tsx` file is also created in the same directory as the component/container to preview the component/container.

Use `npm run storybook` to spin up the Storybook environment at `http://localhost:6006/`.

[Here](https://storybook.js.org/docs) is the official Storybook documentation.

### IV. Sandbox environment
The Sandbox is an HTML file with minimal application setup to deploy your drop-in. It is useful for testing and integration between different pieces of your project.

To render your container in the sandbox, update the `examples/html-host/index.html` file.
Use `npm run serve` to spin up the Sandbox environment at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Understanding the drop-in sandbox environment
The following steps will help you navigate previewing your drop-in in the Sandbox Environment, `examples/html-host/index.html`.
<Tasks>
<Task>

### Import map configuration
```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@dropins/tools/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@dropins/tools/",
      "my-pkg/": "http://localhost:3002/"
    }
  }
</script>
```

This tells the browser:

- **Adobe Commerce tools**: `@dropins/tools/` (served from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@dropins/tools/`)
- **Your drop-in code**: `my-pkg/` (served from `http://localhost:3002/`)

> **Tip:** Replace `my-pkg/` with your drop-in's npm name, for example, `@dropins/cart/`.  
> Add and edit other imports for your drop-in as needed.

</Task>

<Task>
### Core imports
```javascript
// Import API functions to use with action buttons
// Replace `my-pkg` with `@dropins/YourDropin`
import * as pkg from 'my-pkg/api.js';
// or more specifically:
import { myFunction } from 'my-pkg/api.js';
```
```javascript
// The event bus is a core communication tool for all drop-ins. 
// They subscribe and publish to events to talk to each other without direct coupling.
import { events } from '@dropins/tools/event-bus.js';
```
*For Mesh-based Drop-ins (for example, Cart):*
```javascript

// GraphQL Client - For data fetching
import * as mesh from '@dropins/tools/fetch-graphql.js';

// Initialize GraphQL Client (Mesh)
// Replace with your actual endpoint
mesh.setEndpoint('your-endpoint');
```

*For Direct API-based drop-ins (for example, Recommendations):*

```javascript
// Configure API
// Replace with your actual endpoint
pkg.setEndpoint('your-endpoint');
```

*Initializers*

The initializer is a lifecycle management system that handles the setup, configuration, and coordination of components in the application.

```javascript
import { initializers } from '@dropins/tools/initializer.js';
```
</Task>

<Task>

### Drop-in container setup
Uncomment and modify these lines to set up your container.

```javascript
// import { render as provider } from 'my-pkg/render.js';
// import <Container> from 'my-pkg/containers/<Container>.js';
```
For example:

```javascript
import { render as provider } from '@dropins/cart/render.js';
import MiniCart from '@dropins/cart/containers/MiniCart.js';
```

</Task>

### Sandbox structure
The sandbox environment is divided into three main sections:

#### 1. Action Controls (Top)
Controls for triggering functionality:

```html
<fieldset class="actions">
  <legend>API Functions</legend>
  <button id="action-1" disabled>Action</button>
</fieldset>
```

Example usage:

```javascript
const $action_1 = document.getElementById('action-1');
$action_1.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log("action-1 has been clicked");
  myFunction(); // or pkg.myFunction();
});
```

#### 2. Data/debug display (Middle)
Real-time data and response visualization:

```html
<code data-label="fetchGraphQl">
  <pre id="data">⏳ Loading...</pre>
</code>
```

Example usage:

```javascript
// Display event data
const $data = document.getElementById('data');
events.on('<eventName>', (data) => {
  $data.innerText = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
});

// Update loading state
$data.innerText = '⏳ Loading...';
```

#### 3. Container display (Bottom)
Where your drop-in components are rendered:

```html
<div class="containers">
  <h2 class="heading">Frontend Containers</h2>
  <div id="my-container" class="container"></div>
</div>
```

Example usage:

```javascript
const $my_container = document.getElementById('my-container');
provider.render(Container, {
  // Your container props
})($my_container);
```

### Styling the sandbox
The Sandbox environment is styled using two stylesheets:

- `style.css` which is the base styling file that handles root-level styles and variables as well as global element styles.  
- `example.css` which is specifically for styling sandbox UI components.

</Tasks>

## Best practices and accessibility
- Use meaningful names for components and API functions.
- Write tests for every component and function.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Document your code and update the MDX docs in `src/docs/`.
- Use Storybook to visually test components.
- Commit early and often; use branches for new features.
- Use clear, simple language in UI and documentation.
- Ensure all components are keyboard accessible.
- Add ARIA labels where appropriate.
- Test with screen readers.

**Common pitfalls:**

- Forgetting to create and update `.env` with the correct endpoint.
- Not running `npm install` after cloning.
- Skipping tests before building for production.

## Summary and next steps
You've learned how to:

- Set up a drop-in component project
- Generate and configure components, API functions, and containers
- Run and test your frontend locally
- Build for production

**Next Steps:**

- Explore advanced component patterns
- Integrate with real backend APIs
- Contribute to the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/adobe-commerce/dropin-template">drop-in template repo</ExternalLink>
