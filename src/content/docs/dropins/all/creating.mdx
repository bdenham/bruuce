This topic describes how to use the `drop-template` repository to create drop-in components for Adobe Commerce Storefronts.

## What are drop-in component templates?

Drop-in templates are GitHub Templates that allow you to quickly create drop-in components with the same structure, branches, files, and best practices built-in. The `dropin-template` repository provides the starting point for creating new drop-ins quickly and consistently.

For more information on GitHub Templates, you can refer to the following resource: [How to Use GitHub Repository Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

## How to use the Adobe Commerce drop-in template

:::note
Supported Node versions are: Maintenance (v20) and Active (v22).

To create a new drop-in component using the Adobe Commerce drop-in template, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. **Navigate to the Template Repository**: Go to https://github.com/adobe-commerce/dropin-template.
1. **Create a New Repository**: Click on the "Use this template" button to create a new repository based on the template. This will generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as the template.
1. **Clone Your New Repository**: You can now clone the newly created repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
1. **Install, Configure, and Launch**: Follow the instructions in your new repo's `README` file to install the dependencies, generate a configuration file, update your Mesh endpoint, and launch your development environment.
</Steps>

That's it! You now have a drop-in application with the same consistency and best practices that Adobe's drop-ins have, built in.

## Adding a shared component to your project
After creating your drop-in component, let's add a shared component from the Storefront SDK. These components are designed to be reusable and customizable, making it easier to build consistent and high-quality user interfaces. Follow the steps below to add a shared component to your drop-in component project.

<Tasks>

<Task>
### Install the `@adobe-commerce/elsie ` package

Run the following command to install the Storefront SDK package:

```txt
npm install @adobe-commerce/elsie
```
</Task>


<Task>
### Generate a container

Run the following command to generate a Container component:

```txt
npx elsie generate container --pathname <MyContainer>
```
</Task>

<Task>
### Generate a UI component
Run the following command to generate a UI component:

```txt
npx elsie generate component --pathname <myUIComponent>
```
</Task>

<Task>
### Use a library component from the SDK

In your generated UI component, import a shared component from the Storefront SDK package and render it. For example, you can add the `Button` component as follows:

   ```javascript
   import { Button } from '@adobe-commerce/elsie';
   
   function MyUiComponent() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Button label="Click Me" />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

</Task>

<Task>
### Add your component to your container

Add your component to the container created in step 2.

</Task>

<Task>

### Render the Container

Update your sandbox environment to render your container in `examples/html-host/index.html`.
