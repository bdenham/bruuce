This topic introduces you to the concept of creating A/B experiments for drop-in components. You will learn how to create experiments, define variants, and track the performance of each variant.

## Big picture

<Callouts>

1. **Experiment**: A test that compares two or more variants of a drop-in component to determine which variant performs better.
1. **Variant**: A version of a drop-in component that is different from the original version. Variants are created to test different features, designs, or content.
1. **Control**: The original version of the drop-in component that is used as a baseline for comparison.
1. **Challenger**: The variant of the drop-in component being tested.

### A/B experiment

A test that compares two or more variants of a drop-in component to determine which variant performs better.

### Variant

A version of a drop-in component that is different from the original version. Variants are created to test different features, designs, or content.

### Control

The original version of the drop-in component that is used as a baseline for comparison.

### Challenger

The variant of the drop-in component being tested.

### Create an experiment

To create an A/B experiment, you need to define the following:

1. **Objective**: Define the goal of the experiment. For example, increase the click-through rate (CTR) of the checkout button.
1. **Hypothesis**: Formulate a hypothesis that states what you expect to happen. For example, changing the color of the checkout button from blue to green will increase the CTR.
1. **Variants**: Create different versions of the drop-in component to test the hypothesis. For example, create a variant with a green checkout button.
1. **Metrics**: Define the key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the experiment. For example, track the CTR of the checkout button for each variant.
</Task>

## Track performance

After launching the experiment, you need to track the performance of each variant to determine which one performs better. Use analytics tools to monitor the KPIs and analyze the results. Based on the data, you can decide whether to implement the changes permanently or revert to the original version.

## Best practices

When creating A/B experiments for drop-in components, consider the following best practices:

- **Start small**: Test one variable at a time to isolate the impact of each change.
- **Use statistical significance**: Ensure that the sample size is large enough to draw valid conclusions.
- **Monitor continuously**: Track the performance of each variant throughout the experiment.
- **Iterate**: Use the results of the experiment to inform future tests and optimizations.

## Next steps

Now that you understand how to create A/B experiments for drop-in components, you can start experimenting with different variants to optimize the performance of your storefront. Remember to analyze the results and iterate on your experiments to drive continuous improvement.
