import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `SearchBarInput` container provides a search input interface with real-time search suggestions and debounced search functionality. It handles user input, triggers search requests, and manages loading and error states.

## Configurations

The `SearchBarInput` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['searchQuery', 'string', 'No', 'Initial search query value to pre-populate the input field.'],
    ['minimumQueryLength', 'number', 'No', 'Minimum number of characters required before triggering search suggestions. Default: 3.'],
    ['debounceDelay', 'number', 'No', 'Delay in milliseconds before executing search after user stops typing. Default: 300.'],
    ['defaultQueryPlaceholder', 'string', 'No', 'Placeholder text displayed in the search input field.'],
    ['routeSearch', 'function', 'No', 'Callback function called when search is executed. Receives the search query as a parameter.'],
    ['slots', 'object', 'No', 'Allows passing custom components for InputForm and SearchIcon slots.'],
  ]}
/>

## Slots

The `SearchBarInput` container supports the following slots:

* **InputForm** - Replaces the entire search input form component
* **SearchIcon** - Customizes the search icon displayed in the input field

{/* ## Events

The `SearchBarInput` container emits the following events:

* **search-input/request** - Emitted when a search suggestion request is triggered
* **search-input/result** - Emitted when search suggestions are received or cleared
* **search/request** - Emitted when a search is executed (on form submission or enter key) */}

## Features

### Debounced search

The container uses debounced search functionality to prevent excessive API calls while the user is typing. The debounce delay can be configured via the `debounceDelay` prop.

### Minimum query length

Search suggestions are only triggered when the query length meets or exceeds the `minimumQueryLength` threshold, helping to reduce unnecessary API calls for very short queries.

### Loading and error states

The container manages loading states during search operations and handles error scenarios, providing feedback to the user through the search input component.

### Event integration

The container integrates with the Adobe Commerce event bus to emit search-related events that other components can listen to and respond accordingly.

## Example

```jsx
import { SearchBarInput } from '@adobe-commerce/storefront-search-dropin';

function SearchPage() {
  const handleRouteSearch = (query) => {
    // Navigate to search results page
    window.location.href = `/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;
  };

  return (
    <SearchBarInput
      searchQuery=""
      minimumQueryLength={2}
      debounceDelay={250}
      defaultQueryPlaceholder="Search products..."
      routeSearch={handleRouteSearch}
      slots={{
        SearchIcon: {
          component: CustomSearchIcon
        }
      }}
    />
  );
}
