import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `Facets` container displays a list of search filters (`facets`) that allow users to refine their product search results. It manages facet selections, displays selected filters with remove options, and provides a "Clear All" functionality to reset all filter selections.

## Configurations

The `Facets` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['slots', 'object', 'No', 'Allows passing custom components for Facet, SelectedFacets, and Facets slots.'],
  ]}
/>

## Slots

The `Facets` container supports the following slots:

* **Facets** - Customizes the entire facets list container
* **Facet** - Customizes individual facet components
* **SelectedFacets** - Customizes the selected filters display area

Each slot receives a `context` object containing:
- `data` - The relevant data for that slot (facet list, individual facet, or selected facets)

{/* ## Events

The `Facets` container listens to and emits the following events:

### Listens to:
* **search/result** - Listens for search results to update available facets and maintain selection state

### Emits:
* **search/request** - Emitted when facet selections change to trigger a new search with updated filters */}

## Features

### Multiple facet types
The container supports different types of facets:

- **Range Buckets** - For numeric ranges (e.g., price ranges) using radio buttons
- **Scalar Buckets** - For discrete values (e.g., brands, colors) using checkboxes  
- **Category View** - For category-based filtering using checkboxes

### Selection management

- Maintains facet selection state across search requests
- Automatically updates selections based on current search filters
- Provides visual feedback for selected filters

### Selected filters display

- Shows all currently selected filters as removable buttons
- Displays filter labels with appropriate formatting (including currency for price ranges)
- Provides individual remove functionality for each selected filter

### Clear all functionality

- "Clear All" button to remove all selected filters at once
- Automatically triggers a new search with no filters applied

## Facet selection behavior

### Range buckets (radio buttons)

- Only one range can be selected at a time
- Selecting a new range automatically deselects the previous one
- Commonly used for price ranges, ratings, or other numeric ranges

### Scalar buckets (checkboxes)

- Multiple values can be selected simultaneously
- Each selection is independent of others
- Commonly used for brands, colors, sizes, or other discrete attributes
