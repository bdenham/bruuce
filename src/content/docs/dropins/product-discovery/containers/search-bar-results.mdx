The `SearchBarResults` container displays a dropdown list of product search suggestions that appears when users type in the search input. It listens for search input events, manages the display state of results, and provides options to view individual products or execute a full search.

## Configurations

The `SearchBarResults` container provides the following configuration options:

<OptionsTable
  compact
  options={[
    ['Option', 'Type', 'Req?', 'Description'],
    ['products', 'Product[]', 'No', 'Initial array of products to display as search suggestions. Default: empty array.'],
    ['productRouteSearch', 'function', 'No', 'Callback function that returns a URL for a specific product. Receives a Product object as parameter.'],
    ['routeSearch', 'function', 'No', 'Callback function called when "View All" is clicked. Receives the search query as a parameter.'],
    ['slots', 'object', 'No', 'Allows passing custom components for ProductImage, ProductName, and ProductPrice slots.'],
  ]}
/>

* **ProductImage** - Customizes the product image display in search suggestions

* **ProductPrice** - Customizes the product price display in search suggestions

Each slot receives a `context` object containing:
- `productItem` - The Product object for the current item

### View all functionality

The **View All** button allows users to execute a full search query, typically navigating to a search results page.
