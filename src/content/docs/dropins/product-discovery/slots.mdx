Learn about the slots provided in the Product Discovery drop-in component.

[Extending drop-in components](/dropins/all/extending/) describes default properties available to all slots.

## ProductList slots

The slots for the `ProductList` container allow you to customize the appearance of the product list.

```js
interface ProductListProps

slots?: {
    Header?: SlotProps;
    ProductActions?: SlotProps;
    ProductPrice?: SlotProps;
    ProductName?: SlotProps;
    ProductImage?: SlotProps;
    Footer?: SlotProps;
};
```

### Header and Footer slot

The `Header` and `Footer` slot allow you to change content at the top and bottom of the `ProductList` container.

The context object passed to the callback function includes a `productList` property that contains the product list data as an array of product objects.

### Product slots

The `Product<type>` slots allow you to add content to the `ProductListItem` component for each product in search query results.

The context object passed to the callback function includes a `product` property that contains the product data with the following type:

```typescript
export interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  sku: string;
  shortDescription: string;
  url: string;
  urlKey: string;
  metaTitle: string;
  metaKeywords: string;
  metaDescription: string;
  lowStock: boolean;
  links: any[];
  images: ProductImage[];
  description: string;
  externalId: string;
  inputOptions: any[];
  addToCartAllowed: boolean;
  price?: ProductViewPrice;
  priceRange?: {
    minimum: ProductViewPrice;
    maximum: ProductViewPrice;
  };
  inStock: boolean;
  typename: string;
  initialized?: boolean;
}

export interface ProductViewPrice {
  final: ProductPrice;
  regular: ProductPrice;
  roles?: string[];
}

export interface ProductPrice {
  amount: {
    value: number;
    currency: string;
  };
}

export interface ProductImage {
  label: string;
  roles: string[];
  url: string;
}
```

#### Example implementation

Here is an example of how to use the `ProductName` slot to prepend the SKU of each product in the list:

```js
provider.render(ProductList, {
    slots: {
          ProductName: (ctx) => {
            const skuDiv = document.createElement('div');
            skuDiv.innerHTML = ctx.product.sku;
            ctx.prependSibling(skuDiv);
          },
        },
})($productListContainer);
```
