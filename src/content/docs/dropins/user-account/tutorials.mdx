## Customize the layout of the AddressForm

The AddressForm container provides a highly configurable and customizable layout for seamless integration. The sorting of address attributes is managed through the Adobe Commerce Admin settings, giving flexibility in how data fields are displayed.

The visual layout of the form, including input widths (such as 50% or 100% to position multiple inputs on the same line), is controlled by CSS. This enables integrators to tailor the form's appearance by applying custom CSS rules.

By default, the first name and last name fields in the address form are set to 50% width. The display is controlled through CSS, as the form is implemented using a grid layout:

  ![Default AddressForm container](@images/dropins/user-account/address-form-two-column.png)
</Diagram>

To modify the layout and render these fields as full-width, create custom CSS rules at the boilerplate level and use them to override default container CSS:

  ![One column AddressForm container](@images/dropins/user-account/address-form-one-column.png)
</Diagram>

Using this approach, you can easily customize the address form layout during the integration process, such as implementing a three-column layout to display three fields in a row. These adjustments require only basic CSS knowledge for effective customization.

This approach is fully applicable to address forms in all views of the Addresses container, as it utilizes the AddressForm container internally.

### Layout Customisation Example

The folllwing examples show how to adjust the [storefront-addresses](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/blob/develop/blocks/commerce-addresses/commerce-addresses.css) block CSS in a boilerplate environment to customize the address form layout.

In the default layout, some fields are half width, while others take up the whole width.

<Diagram caption="Default layout of the AddressForm container">
  ![Default layout of the AddressForm container](@images/dropins/user-account/initial-form-layout.png)
</Diagram>

To set all fields to half width, add the following CSS rule to the `storefront-addresses` block:

```css
.commerce-addresses .account-address-form {
   grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr);
}
```

<Diagram caption="Two column layout of the AddressForm container">
  ![Two column layout of the AddressForm container](@images/dropins/user-account/two-column-layout.png)
</Diagram>

To set the text area and buttons group set to 100% width while the other fields are half width:

```css
.commerce-addresses .account-address-form div.account-address-form__field--test_text_area,
.commerce-addresses .account-address-form div.account-address-form-wrapper__buttons {
   grid-column: span 2;
}
```
Notice that CSS selector includes the modifier `--test_text_area`, allowing you to target a specific field by attribute code.

  ![Two column layout with full width text box](@images/dropins/user-account/mixed-layout.png)
</Diagram>

To create a three-column layout with a full size text and button area, set the grid template columns to `repeat(2,1fr)`:

```css
.commerce-addresses .account-address-form {
   grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr);
}

.commerce-addresses .account-address-form div.dropin-field {
   grid-column: span 1;
}

.commerce-addresses .account-address-form div.account-address-form__field--test_text_area,
.commerce-addresses .account-address-form div.account-address-form-wrapper__buttons {
   grid-column: span 3;
}
```
