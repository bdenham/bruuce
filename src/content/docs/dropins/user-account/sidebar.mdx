The user account sidebar is not part of the account component, but it is implemented as a block within the boilerplate (`commerce-account-sidebar`). Its primary function is to render a configurable sidebar menu for the user account, managed through SharePoint.

## Configurations

The `commerce-account-sidebar` block can be integrated into various pages via SharePoint, as demonstrated in the screenshot below.

The content of the `commerce-account-sidebar` block is fully manageable through SharePoint, specifically within the `/customer/sidebar-fragment.docx` document. This structure allows for easy customization and updates, as shown in the following example:

The configuration structure includes:

* **Menu item name**
  * **Second line** (optional descriptive text)
  * **Link** (URL for navigation)
  * **SDK icon name** (icon representation for each menu item)
