The `Addresses` container is a standalone component that creates, edits, and deletes customer addresses. It supports custom address attributes and configurable validation through the Adobe Commerce Admin.

The `Addresses` container relies on the [`AddressForm`](../address-form/) container for address creation and editing. It inherits all behaviors from the `AddressForm` container.

The Addresses container is available in three views:

* **Full-size**: Used when the `Addresses` component functions as a standalone page. This view displays all addresses, enables pagination (based on backend configurations), and provides full functionality for managing addresses. At the bottom of the address list, a "Create Address" button is available, which opens the address creation form configurable from the Admin.

* **Minified**: Designed for use when the container is part of a page with other components, such as a user account dashboard. In this view, editing and deletion functionality is disabled, and the "Create New Address" button is replaced with a "View All Addresses" button. Only the default shipping and billing addresses are visible.

* **Selectable**: Intended for scenarios that require address selection, such as during checkout. This view includes styling adjustments and represents each address card as a selectable radio button, facilitating address selection.
