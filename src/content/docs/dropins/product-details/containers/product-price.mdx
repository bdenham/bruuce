import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `ProductPrice` container displays the price of a product on the product details page. It uses the Price and PriceRange components to show the product's price information, including special prices and regular prices if they are available and visible.

The component also listens for data and locale changes via an event bus and updates the displayed price accordingly. It fetches initial product data using the getFetchedProductData function.

## ProductPrice configurations

The `ProductPrice` container does not provide any configuration options. The container receives initial product data to preload the component during [initialization](/dropins/product-details/initialization/).
