import OptionsTable from '@components/OptionsTable.astro';

The `ProductAttributes` container displays a list of attributes for a product on the product details page. It fetches product data and updates its state when new data is available. The component also handles localization for date attributes.

## ProductAttributes configurations

The `ProductAttributes` container does not provide any configuration options. The container receives initial product data to preload the component during [initialization](/dropins/product-details/initialization/).
