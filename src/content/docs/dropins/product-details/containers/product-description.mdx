The `ProductDescription` container displays the detailed description of a product on the product details page. It fetches product data and updates its state when new data is available.

## ProductDescription configurations

The `ProductDescription` container does not provide any configuration options. The container receives initial product data to preload the component during [initialization](/dropins/product-details/initialization/).
