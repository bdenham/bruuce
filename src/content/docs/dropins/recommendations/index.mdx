The product recommendations drop-in component provides a powerful way to suggest products to customers based on their browsing patterns and behaviors. These recommendations are displayed as units with descriptive labels such as "Customers who viewed this product also viewed" or "Customers who bought this product also bought". The component can be managed and deployed across different store views directly from the Adobe Commerce Admin.
