The CSS classes for each UI component that provides the recommendations drop-in component with its UI are provided here. Override these classes and add new classes to customize the look and feel of your recommendations to match your specific style requirements.

## Customizing your recommendations styles

The quickest way to override the recommendations CSS is to inspect the recommendation UI from your browser's developer tools.

1. **Inspect the element** in the UI that you want to customize (right-click on the element and select "Inspect" from the menu).
1. **Identify the CSS class(es)** for the element. We use [BEM naming](https://getbem.com/naming/), which makes it easy to know which component you're changing (and which CSS file to use). This class styles the `Recommendations` component, so use your `recommendations.css` file.
1. **Copy the CSS class** to your `recommendations.css` file to override the existing rules or add new rules to the class. But wait! Look closely üßê at the `.dropin-product-item-card__title` class. It's using **design token**. And when you see a design token within a CSS rule, don't remove the token. Instead, change the token's value (where it's defined) OR create a new token along-side this existing one to ensure maintenance and updates continue to benefit from global design token usage.

## Example CSS overrides

Here's an example of adding CSS class overrides to your `recommendations.css` file:

```css title="recommendations.css"
.dropin-product-item-card__title {
    font: var(--type-body-1-strong-font);
    letter-spacing: var(--type-body-1-strong-letter-spacing);
}

.dropin-product-item-card__sku, .dropin-product-item-card__price {
    font: var(--type-body-1-default-font);
}

.dropin-product-item-card__action {
    margin-top: var(--spacing-xsmall);
    width: 100%;
}
```
