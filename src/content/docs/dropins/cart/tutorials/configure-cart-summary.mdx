## Change the product quantity selector to a dropdown menu:

By default, the product quantity selector is a stepper, as shown below:



<Steps>

1. Navigate to the `blocks/commerce-cart/commerce-cart.js` file and enable the dropdown selector by adding the following lines to the `provider.render(CartSummaryList)` method:

   ```js
   quantityType: 'dropdown',
   dropdownOptions,
   ```

   The `quantityType` property specifies the type of quantity selector to use. The `dropdownOptions` property specifies the values to display in the dropdown. It is defined in the next step.

1. Configure the dropdown values. Here, we

   ```js
   const DROPDOWN_MAX_QUANTITY = 20;

   const dropdownOptions = Array.from(
     { length: parseIng(DROPDOWN_MAX_QUANTITY, 19) },
     (_, i) => {
         const quantityOption =n i + 1;
         return {
           value: `${quantityOption}`,
           text: `${quantityOption}`,
         };
     }
     );
     ```

1. Save the file and generate the page to see the changes.

## Display savings as a percentage or a fixed amount:

<Steps>

1. Add the following lines to the `provider.render(CartSummaryList)` method, below the `dropdownOptions,` line:

   ```js
   showDiscount: true,
   //showSavings: true
   ```

   Comment out one of the lines to choose between displaying the discount as a percentage or a fixed amount.

1. Save the file and generate the page to see the changes.

## Configure the savings display from Google Drive or Sharepoint

You might want to allow a merchandiser or other non-developer to configure how to display savings values. To do this, you'll need to make some more changes to the `commerce-cart.js` file. You'll also need to make some modifications to the starter content boilerplate templates stored on Google Drive or Sharepoint.

<Steps>

1. Comment out the savings properties from the `provider.render(CartSummaryList)` method.

    ```js
    //showDiscount: true,
    //showSavings: true
    ```

1. Add the following lines to the constant definitions in the `export default async function decorate(block){}` statement:

   ```js
   'show-discount': showDiscount = 'false',
   'show-savings': showSavings = 'false',
   ```

1. Add new lines in the `provider.render(CartSummaryList)` method to check whether `showDiscount` or `showSavings` is set to `true`:

   ```js
   showDiscount: showDiscount === 'true',
   showSavings: showSavings === 'true',
   ```

1. Save the file. When you generate the page, discounts are not displayed because the default values are `false`.

1. Find the `cart.docx` starter content file in the Google Drive or Sharepoint folder and add two rows to the Commerce Cart table that set the visibility values for these properties.

   <Diagram caption="Commerce Cart table">
      ![Commerce Cart table](@images/dropins/cart/cart-table.png)
   </Diagram>

   Set the values of the Show Discount and Show Savings rows to either `true` or `false`, but do not set both to `true`.
