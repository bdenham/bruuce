This tutorial describes how to make the following customizations to the `CartSummaryList` container using the Adobe Commerce Boilerplate:

- Change the product quantity selector to a dropdown menu.
- Configure how to display savings.
- Configure the savings display from the Cart content document.

## Step-by-step

The following steps describe how to modify the [commerce-cart.js](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/blob/main/blocks/commerce-cart/commerce-cart.js) block file in the boilerplate template to add custom content to the `CartSummaryList` container.

### Change the product quantity selector to a dropdown menu

By default, the product quantity selector is a stepper, as shown below:

<Diagram caption="Stepper quantity selector">
   ![Stepper quantity selector](@images/dropins/cart/cart-summary-stepper.png)
</Diagram>

In this task, you'll change the quantity selector to a dropdown menu. The dropdown allows shoppers to select a maximum of 20 items.

   ![Dropdown quantity selector](@images/dropins/cart/cart-summary-dropdown.png)
</Diagram>

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the `blocks/commerce-cart/commerce-cart.js` file and enable the dropdown selector by adding the following lines to the `provider.render(CartSummaryList)` method:

   ```js
   quantityType: 'dropdown',
   dropdownOptions,
   ```

   The `quantityType` property specifies the type of quantity selector to use. The `dropdownOptions` property specifies the values to display in the dropdown. It is defined in the next step.

1. Define the `dropdownOptions` constant at the top of the file, in the `export defult async function decorate(block){}` statement.

   ```js
   const DROPDOWN_MAX_QUANTITY = 20;

   const dropdownOptions = Array.from(
     { length: parseInt(DROPDOWN_MAX_QUANTITY, 10) },
     (_, i) => {
         const quantityOption = i + 1;
         return {
           value: `${quantityOption}`,
           text: `${quantityOption}`,
         };
     }
   );
     ```

     This code creates an array of objects with `value` and `text` properties. The `value` property is the quantity value, and the `text` property is the text displayed in the dropdown.

1. Save the file and generate the page to see the changes.

### Display savings as a percentage or a fixed amount

In order to encourage shoppers to buy more, you can display the savings they'll get by purchasing more items. You can display the savings on an item that's on sale as a percentage or as a fixed amount.

<Diagram caption="Savings expressed as a percentage">

</Diagram>

<Diagram caption="Savings expressed as a total">
   ![Savings expressed as a percentage](@images/dropins/cart/cart-summary-total.png)
</Diagram>

<Steps>

1. Add the following lines to the `provider.render(CartSummaryList)` method, below the `dropdownOptions,` line:

   ```js
   showDiscount: true,
   //showSavings: true
   ```

   Comment out one of the lines to choose between displaying the discount as a percentage or a fixed amount.

1. Save the file and generate the page to see the changes.

### Configure the savings display from the Cart content document

To allow a merchandiser or other non-developer to configure how to display savings values, you need to make more changes to the `commerce-cart.js` file and the relevant content documents. For guidance on starter content and the Sidekick browser extension, review [Create your storefront](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/get-started/).

<Steps>

1. Comment out the savings properties from the `provider.render(CartSummaryList)` method.

    ```js
    //showDiscount: true,
    //showSavings: true
    ```

1. Add the following lines to the constant definitions in the `export default async function decorate(block){}` statement:

   ```js
   'show-discount': showDiscount = 'false',
   'show-savings': showSavings = 'false',
   ```

1. Add new lines in the `provider.render(CartSummaryList)` method to check whether `showDiscount` or `showSavings` is set to `true`:

   ```js
   showDiscount: showDiscount === 'true',
   showSavings: showSavings === 'true',
   ```

1. Save the file. When you generate the page, discounts are not displayed because the default values are `false`.

1. Find the `cart` content document in your site's content folder, and add two rows to the Commerce Cart table that set the visibility values for these properties.

   <Diagram caption="Commerce Cart table">
      ![Commerce Cart table](@images/dropins/cart/cart-table.png)
   </Diagram>

   Set the values of the Show Discount and Show Savings rows to either `true` or `false`.

1. Preview the changes with the Sidekick browser extension. Then publish the changes to your staging or production environment.
