## Code changes

Every release includes changes to one or more codebases described in the compatibility section of each release suite. The scope of the change determines whether the MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH number increases in the application's version according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes  
> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner  
> PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes  

### Public API

To determine when we increment the MAJOR version we must define a public API. The public API for drop-in components includes the following:

#### Integration APIs

Integration APIs are functions that are exposed to the storefront application to integrate the drop-in components. These functions are defined in the drop-in SDK and are used by the drop-in components.

| File | Function Signatures |
|---|---|
| `@dropins/tools/fetch-graphql.js` | `setEndpoint`<br/>`setFetchGraphQlHeader`<br/>`removeFetchGraphQlHeader`<br/>`setFetchGraphQlHeaders`<br/>`fetchGraphQl`<br/>`getConfig` |
| `@dropins/tools/event-bus.js` | `on`<br/>`emit`<br/>`lastPayload` |
| `@dropins/tools/initializer.js` | `mountImmediately` |
| `@dropins/tools/lib.js` | `debounce`<br/>`getFormValues`<br/>`getFormErrors`<br/>`classes`<br/>`deepmerge`<br/>`merge`<br/>`generateSrcset` |

#### Slots

Slots are built-in extension points in the drop-in components to add your own UI components and functions. The following table lists the default properties and individual drop-in slots that are available:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Default properties available to all slots: | Function signatures of the following functions:<br/>`prependSibling`<br/>`prependChild`<br/>`replaceWith`<br/>`appendChild`<br/>`appendSibling`<br/>`getSlotElement`<br/>`onChange` |
| | Structure of the [`dictionary`](/dropins/all/labeling/) object |
| Individual drop-in slots | Function signatures as defined elsewhere on this site (for example, [cart slots](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/dropins/cart/slots/)) |

#### Drop-in design tokens

Drop-in [design tokens](/dropins/all/branding/#design-tokens) are defined in the drop-in SDK and are used by the drop-in components to style the storefront application.
