description: Learn about the compatibility, code changes, and public API for Adobe Commerce storefront application releases.
---

import Aside from '@components/Aside.astro';

Adobe organizes storefront application releases into logical suite versions and follows a regular release schedule (approximately once a month). However, Adobe may release updates more frequently to deliver new features or address critical issues. 

## Compatibility table

The following table shows the compatibility between all of the storefront release items by suite version:

| Storefront suite | | 1.0.0 |
|---|---|---|
| **Adobe Commerce** | | 2.4.7 |
| **Storefront Compatibility Package** | | 4.7.0 |
| **Drop-in SDK** | | `@dropins/tools@0.38.0`<br/>`@dropins/build-tools@0.1.1` |
| **Drop-in components** | | `@dropins/storefront-cart@1.0.1`<br/>`@dropins/storefront-checkout@1.0.0`<br/>`@dropins/storefront-order@1.0.0`<br/>`@dropins/storefront-payment-services@1.0.1`<br/>`@dropins/storefront-pdp@1.0.0`<br/>`@dropins/storefront-user-account@1.0.0`<br/>`@dropins/storefront-user-auth@1.0.0` |

## Code changes

Every release includes changes to one or more codebases described in the [compatibility table](/releases/#compatibility-table). The scope of the change determines whether the MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH number increases in the application's version according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes  
> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner  
> PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes  

<Aside type="note">
The "Storefront suite" version is used for marketing purposes and does not conform to semantic versioning.
</Aside>

### Public API

To determine when we increment the MAJOR version we must define a public API. The public API for drop-in components includes the following:

#### Integration APIs

Integration APIs are functions that are exposed to the storefront application to integrate the drop-in components. These functions are defined in the drop-in SDK and are used by the drop-in components.

| File | Function Signatures |
|---|---|
| `@dropins/tools/fetch-graphql.js` | `setEndpoint`<br/>`setFetchGraphQlHeader`<br/>`removeFetchGraphQlHeader`<br/>`setFetchGraphQlHeaders`<br/>`fetchGraphQl`<br/>`getConfig` |
| `@dropins/tools/event-bus.js` | `on`<br/>`emit`<br/>`lastPayload` |
| `@dropins/tools/initializer.js` | `mountImmediately` |
| `@dropins/tools/lib.js` | `debounce`<br/>`getFormValues`<br/>`getFormErrors`<br/>`classes`<br/>`deepmerge`<br/>`merge`<br/>`generateSrcset` |

#### Slots

Slots are built-in extension points in the drop-in components to add your own UI components and functions. The following table lists the default properties and individual drop-in slots that are available:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Default properties available to all slots: | Function signatures of the following functions:<br/>`prependSibling`<br/>`prependChild`<br/>`replaceWith`<br/>`appendChild`<br/>`appendSibling`<br/>`getSlotElement`<br/>`onChange` |
| | Structure of the [`dictionary`](/dropins/all/labeling/#drop-in-component-dictionaries) object |
| Individual drop-in slots | Function signatures as defined elsewhere on this site (for example, [cart slots](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/dropins/cart/slots/)) |

#### Drop-in design tokens

Drop-in [design tokens](/dropins/all/branding/#design-tokens) are defined in the drop-in SDK and are used by the drop-in components to style the storefront application.

## Drop-in components

These release notes summarize changes for drop-in component releases.

### Checkout

#### v1.4.0

_May ??, 2025_

New `TitleProps` interface added to customize the title of some containers.

Visit the [Title and heading customization](/dropins/checkout/containers/overview/#title-and-heading-customization) documentation for more information.

The `LoginForm` container configuration structure has been modified. New properties are added to the `LoginFormProps` interface:

- **`LoginFormProps.displayHeadingContent` property added**: This property allows displaying the container heading content.
- **`LoginFormProps.slots.Heading` property added**: This property allows customizing the container heading content based on the user authentication status.

And `LoginFormProps` interface is extending from `TitleProps` interface inheriting the following properties:

- **`LoginFormProps.displayTitle` property inherited**: This property allows displaying the container title.
- **`LoginFormProps.slots.Title` property inherited**: This property allows customizing the container title.

Visit the [LoginForm](/dropins/checkout/containers/login-form) documentation for more information.

The `PaymentMethods` container configuration structure has been modified. New properties are added to the `PaymentMethodsProps` interface:

- **`PaymentMethodsProps.UIComponentType` property added**: This property allows using a different UI component type as a selector for each payment method. UI components available are: 'ToggleButton' and 'RadioButton'.

And `PaymentMethodsProps` interface is extending from `TitleProps` interface inheriting the following properties:

- **`PaymentMethodsProps.displayTitle` property inherited**: This property allows displaying the container title.
- **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Title` property inherited**: This property allows customizing the container title.

Visit the [PaymentMethods](/dropins/checkout/containers/payment-methods) documentation for more information.

The `ShippingMethods` container configuration structure has been modified. New properties are added to the `ShippingMethodsProps` interface:

- **`ShippingMethodsProps.UIComponentType` property added**: This property allows using a different UI component type as a selector for each shipping method. UI components available are: 'ToggleButton' and 'RadioButton'.

The `ShippingMethodsProps` interface extends the `TitleProps` interface and inherits the following properties:

- **`ShippingMethodsProps.displayTitle` property inherited**: This property displays or hides the container title.
- **`ShippingMethodsProps.slots.Title` property inherited**: This property allows customizing the container title.

Visit the [ShippingMethods](/dropins/checkout/containers/shipping-methods) documentation for more information.

The `TermsAndConditions` container is now visible for both the anonymous and authenticated checkout processes.

Visit the [Terms And Conditions](/dropins/checkout/containers/terms-and-conditions) documentation for more information.

#### v1.3.0

_March 06, 2025_

New `TermsAndConditions` container added.

Visit the [Terms And Conditions](/dropins/checkout/containers/terms-and-conditions) documentation for more information.

#### v1.2.0

_February 11, 2025_

The `PlaceOrder` container configuration structure has been modified. A new property is added to the `PlaceOrderProps` interface:

- **`PlaceOrderProps.slots.Content` property added**: This property allows setting the container content based on the selected payment method. This solves the way how to set the container content dynamically based on the selected payment method, instead of having to modify the text of the container manipulating directly the DOM and detecting payment method selection by handling the PaymentMethods slot, which is not ideal for maintainability.

Visit the [Place Order](/dropins/checkout/containers/place-order) documentation for more information.

#### v1.1.0

_February 03, 2025_

The `PaymentMethods` container configuration structure has been modified. The `PaymentMethodsProps` interface has been changed and some properties have been _deprecated_ and replaced:

- **`PaymentMethodsProps.setOnChange` property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.setOnChange`.
- **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Handlers` property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.render`.
- **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods` property added**: This property is an object that consists of a list of payment method codes that provide a set of configurations to customize each payment method individually.
- **Configurations accepted by payment methods:**
  - The `displayLabel` configuration hides the payment method label (for example, if you only want to display the icon).
  - The `enabled` configuration allows merchants to individually hide payment methods filtering them from the available payment methods list (for example, it is useful when a payment provider has enabled a payment method in the backend, which is configured with more than one payment option and you don't want to display one of them).
  - The `icon` configuration specifies the name of the icon to be shown beside of the label. The icon name must exist within the list of available icons defined in the drop-ins SDK.
  - The `setOnChange` configuration sets the payment method automatically when it is selected. Only if a payment method is specifically set to _false_, the container will not automatically set the payment method to the cart when selected (for example, if a payment method needs to obtain more information during the place order action).
  - The `render` configuration is a handler used to render and configure the payment method.
