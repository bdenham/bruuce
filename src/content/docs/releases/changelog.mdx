    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-06-24"
      title="Boilerplate Refactoring"
      components={['Boilerplate']}
    >
      The `scripts.js` file has been refactored to align with the upstream AEM Boilerplate while extracting all commerce-specific functionality into `scripts/commerce.js`. This refactoring provides better separation of concerns and improved maintainability.

      **Key Changes:**
      - **`scripts.js`** now contains only core AEM functionality (aligned with upstream AEM Boilerplate)
      - **`commerce.js`** now contains all commerce-specific functionality including:
        - GraphQL queries and commerce backend connections
        - Template handling and application
        - Commerce page type detection
        - Adobe Data Layer initialization
        - Commerce utilities (`rootLink`, `fetchPlaceholders`, etc.)
        - Modal auto-linking functionality
        - Commerce-specific preloading logic

      **Import Updates Required:**
      Developers need to update import statements from `scripts/scripts.js` to `scripts/commerce.js` for commerce-specific functions:
      ```javascript
      // Before
      import { rootLink } from '../../scripts/scripts.js';
      import { fetchPlaceholders } from '../../scripts/scripts.js';
      
      // After
      import { rootLink } from '../../scripts/commerce.js';
      import { fetchPlaceholders } from '../../scripts/commerce.js';
      ```

      See the [Architecture Overview](/setup/discovery/architecture/) for more details about the refactoring and its benefits.

{/****** 
**Cart** 
********/}

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-08-12"
      title="Cart v1.5.0"
      components={['Cart']}
    >
      The Cart drop-in component has been updated to include the following changes:

      - **Extended Add/Update Cart API**: Added support for custom fields in the `addToCart()` and `updateProductsFromCart()` API functions, enabling developers to set and update custom cart item fields such as `standard_height` and `custom_height` during cart operations.
      - **Fixed missing Channel Field**: Fixed an issue where the `channel` attribute was missing from all Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) events on the Product Details Page. The channel field is now properly populated as part of the global storefront context for all PDP events, ensuring complete event data collection.
      - **Added undo remove cart items**: Introduced configurable functionality to allow users to undo item removals from the cart. When enabled, removed items display an undo banner in their original position while cart totals reflect the removal, with the ability to reinstate items with their original quantity and options. The feature works with both built-in remove buttons and the `updateProductsInCart` API, with customizable undo banner styling.
      - **Enhanced mini cart flexibility**: Redesigned the mini cart layout with reduced container nesting and improved slot architecture, allowing developers to easily wrap individual elements (price, product title, quantity), customize action button placement and styling, add quantity stepper labels, and include specific product attributes with comprehensive documentation.

      - The cart open AEP event now correctly includes `productListItems`, providing more accurate event data.{/*USF-1833*/}
      - The cart view AEP event now includes selected product options and discount information in `productListItems`.{/*USF-1834*/}
      - The add to cart AEP event now populates selected options for complex and bundled products, improving event tracking accuracy.{/*USF-1835*/}

      components={['Checkout']}
    >

      - Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements.

      The **[`Multi-step checkout`](/dropins/checkout/tutorials/multi-step/) tutorial has been updated** providing a customizable example to implement a comprehensive multi-step checkout based on a modular architecture (event-driven step coordination) that supports the following scenarios:

      - Guest users
      - Logged-in customers
      - Virtual products
      - Mixed carts (physical + virtual product combinations)

    </ChangelogEntry>

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-06-25"
      title="Checkout v2.0.0"
      components={['Checkout']}
    >
      The **[`Checkout drop-in GraphQL API`](/dropins/checkout/extending/) has been extended** exposing new fragments:

      - **`BILLING_CART_ADDRESS_FRAGMENT`**
      - **`SHIPPING_CART_ADDRESS_FRAGMENT`**
      - **`AVAILABLE_PAYMENT_METHOD_FRAGMENT`**
      - **`SELECTED_PAYMENT_METHOD_FRAGMENT`**

      The **[`Error Handling`](/dropins/checkout/error-handling/) has been implemented** in some containers (still work in progress):

      - **`BillToShippingAddress`**
      - **`LoginForm`**
      - **`PaymentMethods`**
      - **`ShippingMethods`**

      The **[`Event Handling`](/dropins/checkout/event-handling/) has been documented** within the list of events emitted and subscribed by the Checkout drop-in containers.

      A new **[`Active`](/dropins/checkout/containers/overview/#active-property) property has been added** for all containers: This property activates/deactivates the container.

      A new **[`AutoSync`](/dropins/checkout/containers/overview/#autosync-property) property has been added** for some containers: This property allows the container automatically synchronizing its state changes with the backend.

      A new **[`TitleProps`](/dropins/checkout/containers/overview/#title-and-heading-customization) interface has been created** to customize the title and header of some containers.

      The **[`BillToShippingAddress`](/dropins/checkout/containers/bill-to-shipping-address/) container configuration structure has been modified.** A new property has been added to the `BillToShippingAddressProps` interface:

      - **`BillToShippingAddressProps.onCartSyncError` property added**: This property allows performing some actions in case of an error is thrown when the bill to shipping checkbox is checked.

      Implemented an **error handling mechanism** for the `BillToShippingAddress` container based on the _"Optimistic" UI updates with rollback pattern_ consisting on the following:

        - It provides a callback function **`onCartSyncError()`** to be used in the integration layer in case the merchant wanted to perform some actions like showing an error message etc.

        - It performs a rollback reverting to the previous valid checkbox state.

        - In case the callback is not implemented, a fallback will be used, which consists of displaying an inline alert message.

      The **[`LoginForm`](/dropins/checkout/containers/login-form/) container configuration structure has been modified.** New properties have been added to the `LoginFormProps` interface:

      - **`LoginFormProps.displayHeadingContent` property added**: This property allows displaying the container heading content.

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.onCartSyncError` property added**: This property allows performing some actions in case of an error is thrown during the payment method selection.

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.UIComponentType` property added**: This property allows using a different UI component type as a selector for each payment method. UI components available are: 'ToggleButton' and 'RadioButton'.

      ... and the following properties have been added extending from `TitleProps` interface:

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.displayTitle` property inherited**: This property allows displaying the container title.

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Title` property inherited**: This property allows customizing the container title.

      Implemented an **error handling mechanism** for the `PaymentMethods` container based on the _"Optimistic" UI updates with rollback pattern_ consisting on the following:

        - It provides a callback function **`onCartSyncError()`** to be used in the integration layer in case the merchant wanted to perform some actions like showing an error message etc.

      ... the following property has been renamed:

      - **`ShippingMethodsProps.onShippingMethodSelect` property renamed** to **`ShippingMethodsProps.onSelectionChange`**.

      ... the following properties have been added:

      - **`ShippingMethodsProps.onCartSyncError` property added**: This property allows performing some actions in case of an error is thrown during the shipping method selection.

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-03-06"
      title="Checkout v1.3.0"
      components={['Checkout']}
    >
      A new **[`TermsAndConditions`](/dropins/checkout/containers/terms-and-conditions/) container has been added.**

    </ChangelogEntry>

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-02-11"
      title="Checkout v1.2.0"
      components={['Checkout']}
    >
      The **[`PlaceOrder`](/dropins/checkout/containers/place-order/) container configuration structure has been modified.** A new property has been added to the `PlaceOrderProps` interface:

      - **`PlaceOrderProps.slots.Content` property added**: This property allows setting the container content based on the selected payment method. This solves the way how to set the container content dynamically based on the selected payment method, instead of having to modify the text of the container manipulating directly the DOM and detecting payment method selection by handling the PaymentMethods slot, which is not ideal for maintainability.

    </ChangelogEntry>

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-02-03"
      title="Checkout v1.1.0"
      components={['Checkout']}
    >
      The **[`PaymentMethods`](/dropins/checkout/containers/payment-methods/) container configuration structure has been modified.** The `PaymentMethodsProps` interface has been changed and some properties have been _deprecated_ and replaced:

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.setOnChange` property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.setOnChange`.
      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Handlers` property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following one: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.render`.
      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods` property added**: This property is an object that consists of a list of payment method codes that provide a set of configurations to customize each payment method individually.

        Configurations accepted by payment methods:

          - The `displayLabel` configuration hides the payment method label (for example, if you only want to display the icon).
          - The `enabled` configuration allows merchants to individually hide payment methods filtering them from the available payment methods list (for example, it is useful when a payment provider has enabled a payment method in the backend, which is configured with more than one payment option and you don't want to display one of them).
          - The `icon` configuration specifies the name of the icon to be shown beside of the label. The icon name must exist within the list of available icons defined in the drop-ins SDK.
          - The `setOnChange` configuration sets the payment method automatically when it is selected. Only if a payment method is specifically set to _false_, the container will not automatically set the payment method to the cart when selected (for example, if a payment method needs to obtain more information during the place order action).
         - The `render` configuration is a handler used to render and configure the payment method.
