      date="2025-06-24"
      title="Boilerplate Refactoring"
      components={['Boilerplate']}
    >
      The `scripts.js` file has been refactored to align with the upstream AEM Boilerplate while extracting all commerce-specific functionality into `scripts/commerce.js`. This refactoring provides better separation of concerns and improved maintainability.

      **Key Changes:**
      - **`scripts.js`** now contains only core AEM functionality (aligned with upstream AEM Boilerplate)
      - **`commerce.js`** now contains all commerce-specific functionality including:
        - GraphQL queries and commerce backend connections
        - Template handling and application
        - Commerce page type detection
        - Adobe Data Layer initialization
        - Commerce utilities (`rootLink`, `fetchPlaceholders`, etc.)
        - Modal auto-linking functionality
        - Commerce-specific preloading logic

      **Import Updates Required:**
      Developers need to update import statements from `scripts/scripts.js` to `scripts/commerce.js` for commerce-specific functions:
      ```javascript
      // Before
      import { rootLink } from '../../scripts/scripts.js';
      import { fetchPlaceholders } from '../../scripts/scripts.js';
      
      // After
      import { rootLink } from '../../scripts/commerce.js';
      import { fetchPlaceholders } from '../../scripts/commerce.js';
      ```

      See the [Architecture Overview](/setup/discovery/architecture/) for more details about the refactoring and its benefits.

      - Guest users
      - Logged-in customers
      - Virtual products
      - Mixed carts (physical + virtual product combinations)

    </ChangelogEntry>

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-06-25"
      title="Checkout v2.0.0"
      components={['Checkout']}
    >
      The **[`checkout drop-in component GraphQL API`](/dropins/checkout/extending/) has been extended** exposing new fragments:

      - **`BILLING_CART_ADDRESS_FRAGMENT`**
      - **`SHIPPING_CART_ADDRESS_FRAGMENT`**
      - **`AVAILABLE_PAYMENT_METHOD_FRAGMENT`**
      - **`SELECTED_PAYMENT_METHOD_FRAGMENT`**

      The **[`Error Handling`](/dropins/checkout/error-handling/) has been implemented** in some containers (still work in progress):

      - **`BillToShippingAddress`**
      - **`LoginForm`**
      - **`PaymentMethods`**
      - **`ShippingMethods`**

      The **[`Event Handling`](/dropins/checkout/event-handling/) has been documented** within the list of events emitted and subscribed by the checkout drop-in component containers.

      A new **[`Active`](/dropins/checkout/containers/overview/#active-property) property has been added** for all containers: This property activates/deactivates the container.

      A new **[`AutoSync`](/dropins/checkout/containers/overview/#autosync-property) property has been added** for some containers: This property allows the container automatically synchronizing its state changes with the backend.

      A new **[`TitleProps`](/dropins/checkout/containers/overview/#title-and-heading-customization) interface has been created** to customize the title and header of some containers.

      The **[`BillToShippingAddress`](/dropins/checkout/containers/bill-to-shipping-address/) container configuration structure has been modified.** A new property has been added to the `BillToShippingAddressProps` interface:

      - **`BillToShippingAddressProps.onCartSyncError` property added**: This property allows performing some actions in case of an error is thrown when the bill to shipping checkbox is checked.

      Implemented an **error handling mechanism** for the `BillToShippingAddress` container based on the _"Optimistic" UI updates with rollback pattern_ consisting on the following:

        - It provides a callback function **`onCartSyncError()`** to be used in the integration layer in case the merchant wanted to perform some actions like showing an error message etc.

        - It performs a rollback reverting to the previous valid checkbox state.

        - In case the callback is not implemented, a fallback will be used, which consists of displaying an inline alert message.

      The **[`LoginForm`](/dropins/checkout/containers/login-form/) container configuration structure has been modified.** New properties have been added to the `LoginFormProps` interface:

      - **`LoginFormProps.displayHeadingContent` property added**: This property allows displaying the container heading content.

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.onSelectionChange` property added**: This property allows performing some actions when a payment method is selected.

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.onCartSyncError` property added**: This property allows performing some actions in case of an error is thrown during the payment method selection.

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.UIComponentType` property added**: This property allows using a different UI component type as a selector for each payment method. UI components available are: 'ToggleButton' and 'RadioButton'.

      ... and the following properties have been added extending from `TitleProps` interface:

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.displayTitle` property inherited**: This property allows displaying the container title.

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Title` property inherited**: This property allows customizing the container title.

      Implemented an **error handling mechanism** for the `PaymentMethods` container based on the _"Optimistic" UI updates with rollback pattern_ consisting on the following:

        - It provides a callback function **`onCartSyncError()`** to be used in the integration layer in case the merchant wanted to perform some actions like showing an error message etc.

        - It performs a rollback reverting to the previous valid payment method selected.

        - In case the callback is not implemented, a fallback will be used, which consists of displaying an inline alert message.

      - **`ShippingMethodsProps.preSelectedMethod` property removed**: This was an obsolete and unused property without business logic behind.

      ... the following property has been renamed:

      - **`ShippingMethodsProps.onShippingMethodSelect` property renamed** to **`ShippingMethodsProps.onSelectionChange`**.

      ... the following properties have been added:

      - **`ShippingMethodsProps.onCartSyncError` property added**: This property allows performing some actions in case of an error is thrown during the shipping method selection.

      - **`ShippingMethodsProps.UIComponentType` property added**: This property allows using a different UI component type as a selector for each shipping method. The available UI components are: `ToggleButton` and `RadioButton`.

      ... and the following properties have been added extending from `TitleProps` interface:

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-03-06"
      title="Checkout v1.3.0"
      components={['Checkout']}
    >
      A new **[`TermsAndConditions`](/dropins/checkout/containers/terms-and-conditions/) container has been added.**

    </ChangelogEntry>

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-02-11"
      title="Checkout v1.2.0"
      components={['Checkout']}
    >
      The **[`PlaceOrder`](/dropins/checkout/containers/place-order/) container configuration structure has been modified.** A new property has been added to the `PlaceOrderProps` interface:

      - **`PlaceOrderProps.slots.Content` property added**: This property allows setting the container content based on the selected payment method. This solves the way how to set the container content dynamically based on the selected payment method, instead of having to modify the text of the container manipulating directly the DOM and detecting payment method selection by handling the PaymentMethods slot, which is not ideal for maintainability.

    </ChangelogEntry>

    <ChangelogEntry
      date="2025-02-03"
      title="Checkout v1.1.0"
      components={['Checkout']}
    >
      The **[`PaymentMethods`](/dropins/checkout/containers/payment-methods/) container configuration structure has been modified.** The `PaymentMethodsProps` interface has been changed and some properties have been _deprecated_ and replaced:

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.setOnChange` property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.setOnChange`.
      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Handlers` property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following one: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.render`.
      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods` property added**: This property is an object that consists of a list of payment method codes that provide a set of configurations to customize each payment method individually.

        Configurations accepted by payment methods:

          - The `displayLabel` configuration hides the payment method label (for example, if you only want to display the icon).
          - The `enabled` configuration allows merchants to individually hide payment methods filtering them from the available payment methods list (for example, it is useful when a payment provider has enabled a payment method in the backend, which is configured with more than one payment option and you don't want to display one of them).
          - The `icon` configuration specifies the name of the icon to be shown beside of the label. The icon name must exist within the list of available icons defined in the drop-ins SDK.
          - The `setOnChange` configuration sets the payment method automatically when it is selected. Only if a payment method is specifically set to _false_, the container will not automatically set the payment method to the cart when selected (for example, if a payment method needs to obtain more information during the place order action).
         - The `render` configuration is a handler used to render and configure the payment method.
