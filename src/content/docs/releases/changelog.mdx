      A new [`TermsAndConditions`](/dropins/checkout/containers/terms-and-conditions) container has been added.

    </ChangelogEntry>

    >
      The [`PlaceOrder`](/dropins/checkout/containers/place-order) container configuration structure has been modified. A new property has been added to the `PlaceOrderProps` interface:

      - **`PlaceOrderProps.slots.Content` property added**: This property allows setting the container content based on the selected payment method. This solves the way how to set the container content dynamically based on the selected payment method, instead of having to modify the text of the container manipulating directly the DOM and detecting payment method selection by handling the PaymentMethods slot, which is not ideal for maintainability.

      The [`PaymentMethods`](/dropins/checkout/containers/payment-methods container configuration structure has been modified. The `PaymentMethodsProps` interface has been changed and some properties have been _deprecated_ and replaced:

      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.setOnChange` property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.setOnChange`.
      - **`PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Handlers` property _@deprecated_**: This property is _deprecated_ and will be removed in future versions. It has been replaced by the following: `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods.<payment-method-code>.render`.

      The `PaymentMethodsProps.slots.Methods` property has been added to the [`PaymentMethods`](/dropins/checkout/containers/payment-methods) container. This property is an object that consists of a list of payment method codes that provide a set of configurations to customize each payment method individually.

      Configurations accepted by payment methods:
        - The `displayLabel` configuration hides the payment method label (for example, if you only want to display the icon).
       - The `enabled` configuration allows merchants to individually hide payment methods filtering them from the available payment methods list (for example, it is useful when a payment provider has enabled a payment method in the backend, which is configured with more than one payment option and you don't want to display one of them).
       - The `icon` configuration specifies the name of the icon to be shown beside of the label. The icon name must exist within the list of available icons defined in the drop-ins SDK.
       - The `setOnChange` configuration sets the payment method automatically when it is selected. Only if a payment method is specifically set to _false_, the container will not automatically set the payment method to the cart when selected (for example, if a payment method needs to obtain more information during the place order action).
      - The `render` configuration is a handler used to render and configure the payment method.
