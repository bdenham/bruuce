The Storefront Compatibility Package contains changes to the Adobe Commerce 2.4.7 codebase that enable drop-in component functionality.

Most of these changes enhance the Adobe Commerce GraphQL schema. However, miscellaneous bugfixes are also included. Cart, checkout, user account, and user authentication dropin-in components require the package. Partners can request access to the Storefront Compatibility Package by sending an email to `commerce-storefront-compatibility@adobe.com`.

- `confirmCancelOrder` mutation - Cancels the specified order for a guest.

- `confirmReturn` mutation - Confirms a guest or customer return request.

- [`estimateTotals` mutation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql/schema/cart/mutations/estimate-totals/) - Estimates totals for cart based on the address.

- [`generateCustomerToken` mutation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql/schema/customer/mutations/generate-token/) - Creates a new customer token.

- `guestOrder` query - Retrieves information about a guest order using an order number, email, and billing last name as input.

- `guestOrderByToken` query - Retrieves information about a guest order based on an order token.

- [`recaptchaFormConfig` query](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql/schema/store/queries/recaptcha-form-config/) - Returns information about the reCaptcha configuration for the specified form type.

## Release information

**Latest version:** 4.7.0-beta25

**Release date:** November 17, 2024

### 4.7.0-beta25

- Shipping addresses are stored in customer's address book correctly upon placing an order with the `placeOrder` mutation.

- Added the `guestOrder` and `guestOrderByToken` queries, which retrieve information about guest orders. The `guestOrder` query retrieves order details based on order number, email, and billing last name. The `guestOrderByToken` query retrieves order details based on an order token.

- When using the `customer` query to retrieve a list of `available_actions` when a return has been initiated, the query no longer returns a value of `RETURN`. If returns have been disabled for the system, the `available_actions` field will not list a value of `RETURN`.

- Changed the data type of the following `StoreConfig` fields from `Boolean` to `string`: `display_product_prices_in_catalog`, `display_shipping_prices`, `orders_invoices_credit_memos_display_price`, `orders_invoices_credit_memos_display_subtotal`, `orders_invoices_credit_memos_display_shipping_amount`, `fixed_product_taxes_display_prices_in_product_lists`, `fixed_product_taxes_display_prices_on_product_view_page`, `fixed_product_taxes_display_prices_in_sales_modules`, `fixed_product_taxes_display_prices_in_emails`

- Changed the data type of the `SelectedCustomAttributeInput.value` field from `ID!` to `String!`.

### 4.7.0-beta24

- The `setShippingAddressesOnCart` mutation no longer throws an error when specifying the `pickup_location_code` field.

- `customer` queries using the `items_eligible_for_return` field do not return both parent and child products for configurable products.

- Added the `quantity_return_requested` and `eligible_for_return` fields to `OrderItemInterface`.

- Added the `items_eligible_for_return` field to the `CustomerOrder` type.

- The `eligible_for_return` field no longer returns true on items that have been returned.

- Updated WebAPI tests on shared catalogs.

### 4.7.0-beta23

- Increased the default value for maximum query complexity to 1000.

- Corrected an error that occurred when using the `customer` query to retrieve returns with the "Processed and Closed" status.

### 4.7.0-beta22

- Added the `confirmReturn` and `requestGuestReturn` mutations.

- Added multiple fields to the `StoreConfig` object that return configuration values related to taxes.

- Commerce correctly returns a 401 or 403 error when an expired token is used.

### 4.7.0-beta21

- Added the `requestGuestOrderCancel` mutation.

- Added the `id` field to `CartAddressInterface` so that the value is available to the `customerCart` query.

- Added GraphQL error handling capabilites to `Cart`.

- The trademark symbol is now displayed correctly.

### 4.7.0-beta20

- The `updateCartItems` and `addProductsToCart` mutations now return low quantity totals correctly.

- Added the `Customer.addressesV2` and `Customer.CustomerAddresses` objects, which allow you to specify pagination options.

- Prices for downloadable products that have additional file options are now displayed correctly.

- The `updateCustomerEmail` mutation allows the email to be changed when a custom attribute is not defined for the customer.

- Added the `ShippingCartAddress.same_as_billing` field so that the `cart` and `customerCart` queries can determine whether the shipping addresses and billing address are the same.
