## Overview

Adobe Experience Platform is a suite of services that allows you to collect, manage, and analyze data from your customers. Here's a diagram showcasing the full architecture of Adobe Experience Platform.

You can read more about Adobe Experience Platform in the [Adobe Experience Platform documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/home.html).

The documentation on this page will focus on the integration of the Adobe Commerce on Edge Delivery Services storefront project to Adobe Experience Platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure your integration to Adobe Experience Platform you need to have the following:

* IMS Org Id (e.g. `########@AdobeOrg`)
* Datastream ID (e.g. `########-####-####-####-########`)

{/* You can find your IMS Org Id by... */}

You can find more information about how to create a datastream in the [Adobe Experience Platform documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/datastreams/overview.html).

## Configuration

In order for data to flow from your storefront to the Experience Platform Edge Network you just need to change a few lines of code in your storefront project.

<CodeExample code={`
window.adobeDataLayer.push({
		aepContext: {
				imsOrgId: '########@AdobeOrg',
				datastreamId: '########-####-####-####-########'
		},
		{ eventForwardingContext: { commerce: true, aep: true } },
	},
});
`} lang="js" title="scripts/delayed.js" />

`aepContext` is the context object that contains the IMS Org Id and Datastream ID.

`eventForwardingContext` with `aep: true` tells the Adobe Data Layer to forward the event to the Experience Platform Edge Network and configure it to send to the correct IMS Org and Datastream.

You can see an example of this [here](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/commit/eb49d00bcebd21e48cd87c0efced17d2c6ccfd9d).
