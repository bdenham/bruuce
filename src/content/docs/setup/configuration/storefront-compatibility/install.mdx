The Storefront Compatibility Package contains changes to the Adobe Commerce codebase that enable drop-in component functionality. On [Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/cloud-service/overview), it is installed and updated automatically.

Use this method to install the Storefront Compatibility Package using the Cloud infrastructure.

    1. On your local workstation, change to the project directory for your Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure project.

    1. Check out the environment branch to update using the Adobe Commerce Cloud CLI.

       ```bash
       magento-cloud environment:checkout <environment-id>
       ```

    1. Add the Storefront Compatibility module.

       Use the appropriate package version based on your Adobe Commerce version:

       For Adobe Commerce 2.4.7, run:
       ```bash
       composer require adobe-commerce/storefront-compatibility:4.7.8
       ```
       For Adobe Commerce 2.4.8, run:
       ```bash
       composer require adobe-commerce/storefront-compatibility:4.8.5
       ```

       To check the latest version of the Storefront Compatibility Package, go to the [changelog](/releases/changelog/).

    1. Update package dependencies.

       ```bash
       composer update "adobe-commerce/storefront-compatibility"
       ```

    1. Commit and push code changes for the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.

    1. Add, commit, and push the code changes for the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files to the cloud environment

       ```bash
       git add -A
       git commit -m "Add module"
       git push origin <branch-name>
       ```

       Pushing the updates to the cloud environment initiates the [Commerce cloud deployment process](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/develop/deploy/process) to apply the changes. Check the deployment status from the [deploy log](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/develop/test/log-locations#deploy-log).
