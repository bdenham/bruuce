In this section, you'll learn how Commerce blocks in your storefront connect to a Commerce backend using values from either your site's [public config](https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html#schema/PublicConfig) or a [config.json](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/blob/main/demo-config.json) file in your code repo.

In the [Create your storefront tutorial](/get-started/), the template repo provided you a `demo-config.json` file in the root folder. This file contains the environment values for a Commerce backend including GraphQl endpoints and headers.

When implementing your own project, you must update the configuration values with:
- The header values specific to your Adobe Commerce Catalog Services environment.
- The Adobe Commerce and Catalog Service GraphQL endpoint that you configured as part of the [content delivery network (CDN) setup](/setup/configuration/content-delivery-network/).

### Storefront configuration

A JSON object that maps properties and values used by the Commerce boilerplate.

The storefront configuration is a JSON object which lives in either [config-service](https://www.aem.live/docs/config-service-setup) and contains the connection settings for your Commerce blocks. The boilerplate repo also contains a `demo-config.json` file which can be renamed to `config.json` in lieu of using the config service.

At the root, there is a `public` property which should not be changed, and a nested `default` object. This `default` object is the root level config that is used for your storefront. The config object contains properties and values which correspond to a specific setting or usage in your Commerce backend.

If you use aem.live's config service, your config will live at `https://admin.hlx.page/config/{{ORG}}/sites/{{SITE}}/public.json` but can be overwritten with a local `/config.json` file in your code repo.

### default values

By default, the values in the `demo-config.json` file are from the boilerplate's sample backend to ensure everything works out of the box. But when it comes time to connect your own backend, you need to know what each key means so you can update it with the correct value from your own Commerce instance.

### getConfigValue function

The `getConfigValue` function is a helper function that retrieves the `value` from the `configs` file using the dot-notation path as an argument. For example, `getConfigValue('headers.cs.x-api-key')` returns the value of `[root config].headers.cs.x-api-key`.

### getHeaders function

The `getHeaders` function is a helper function which takes a storefront scope (like `cs`, `cart`, etc) and reads values from the configs file with the corresponding `header` keys and returns an object map of those rows. For example, if you have properties in config like `headers.cs.Magento-Environment-Id": "abc-123"`, then `getHeaders('cs')` will return an object like `{ "Magento-Environment-Id": "abc-123"}`.

## Examples

You can find the `config` file in your code repo at either `/config.json` if you created it, or `demo-config.json`. Open the file to view the connection **keys** and **values** of the sample backend. They should look similar (but not exact) to the following:

```js
{
  "public": {
    "default": {
      "commerce-core-endpoint": "https://www.aemshop.net/graphql",
      "commerce-endpoint": "https://www.aemshop.net/cs-graphql",
      "headers": {
        "all": {
          "Store": "{{YOUR_STOREVIEW_CODE}}"
        },
        "cs": {
          "Magento-Customer-Group": "b6589fc6ab0dc82cf12099d1c2d40ab994e8410c",
          "Magento-Store-Code": "{{YOUR_STORE_CODE}}",
          "Magento-Store-View-Code": "{{YOUR_STOREVIEW_CODE}}",
          "Magento-Website-Code": "{{YOUR_WEBSITE_CODE}}",
          "x-api-key": "{{YOUR_API_KEY}}",
          "Magento-Environment-Id": "{{YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID}}"
        }
      },
      "analytics": {
        "base-currency-code": "USD",
        "environment": "Production",
        "store-id": 1,
        "store-name": "Main Website Store",
        "store-url": "{{YOUR_STORE_URL}}",
        "store-view-id": 1,
        "store-view-name": "Default Store View",
        "website-id": 1,
        "website-name": "Main Website"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The properties listed above are all required, with correct values for your Commerce environment.

All of the initializer blocks now automatically use any headers for the corresponding block if they are in the config. For example `commerce.headers.cart.Foo` will add a `Foo` header to graphql requests made by the cart dropin. This can be useful if you need to append certain headers for specific requests.

## Step-by-step

We'll use a mock PDP / Catalog Service block as an example of where and how to utilize the various config utilities and values.

<Tasks>

<Task>

### Import the getConfigValue function.

First, import the `getConfigValue` function from your boilerplate's `scripts/configs.js` file.

```javascript
import { getConfigValue } from '../../scripts/configs.js';
```

</Task>

<Task>

### Fetch and use some values.

Within the block's `decorate` function, use the `getConfigValue` function which takes a `string` that matches one of the keys from the `configs` file and returns the corresponding value.

```javascript

export default async function decorate(block) {
  // Get the catalog service endpoint
  const endpoint = await getConfigValue('commerce-endpoint');
  // get the catalog service required headers
  const headers = await getHeaders('cs');

  const response = await fetch(endpoint, { headers });

  // do stuff with response
}
```

</Task>

</Tasks>

## Summary

That's all it takes to connect a drop-in component Commerce block to your Commerce backend settings. You'll use the same configuration keys to connect any custom Commerce blocks or new Commerce blocks provided in later releases.
