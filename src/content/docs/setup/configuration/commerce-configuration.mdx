In this section, you'll learn how Commerce blocks in your storefront connect to a Commerce backend using values from the `configs` spreadsheet in the root of your SharePoint content directory.

In the [Create your storefront tutorial](/get-started/), the sample content archive provided you a `configs` spreadsheet file in the root folder. This file contains the environment values for your Commerce backend including GraphQl endpoints and headers.

When implementing your own project, you must update the configuration values with:
- The header values specific to your Adobe Commerce Catalog Services environment.
- The Adobe Commerce and Catalog Service GraphQL endpoint that you configured as part of the [content delivery network (CDN) setup](/setup/configuration/content-delivery-network/).

## Vocabulary

<Vocabulary>
### Storefront configuration

The `configs` spreadsheet contains the connection settings for your Commerce blocks. Each row in the sheet contains a `key` and a `value` that corresponds to a specific setting or usage in your Commerce backend. The `key` is used to retrieve the `value` from the `configs` spreadsheet and is used to connect your Commerce blocks to your Commerce backend.

### default values

By default, the values in the `configs` spreadsheet are from the boilerplate's sample backend to ensure everything works out of the box. But when it comes time to connect your own backend, you need to know what each key means so you can update it with the correct value from your own Commerce instance.

### getConfigValue function

The `getConfigValue` function is a helper function that retrieves the `value` from the `configs` file using the `key` as an argument. The `getConfigValue` function is used to connect your Commerce blocks to your Commerce backend.

### getHeaders function

The `getHeaders` function is a helper function which takes a storefront scope (like `cs`, `cart`, etc) and reads values from the configs file with the corresponding `header` keys and returns an object map of those rows. For example, if you have rows in config like `"commerce.headers.cs.Magento-Environment-Id": "abc-123"`, then `getHeaders('cs')` will return an object like `{ "Magento-Environment-Id": "abc-123"}`.

## Examples

You can find the `configs` file in your content drive by clicking on the mountpoint link in your project's `fstab.yaml` file. You should see the `configs` file at the root of the SharePoint directory. Open the file to view the connection **keys** and **values** of the sample backend. They should look similar (but not exact) to the following:

<OptionsTable
  options={[
    ['#', 'Key', 'Value'],
    ['1', 'commerce-endpoint', 'https://catalog-service.adobe.io/graphql'],
    ['2', 'commerce-core-endpoint', 'https://mystorefront.com/graphql'],
    ['4', 'commerce.headers.cs.Magento-Environment-Id', '7cb935fd-d3bc-487b-9a2f-e5965c30f2a1'],
    ['5', 'commerce.headers.cs.Magento-Website-Code', 'base'],
    ['6', 'commerce.headers.cs.Magento-Store-Code', 'main_website_store'],
    ['7', 'commerce.headers.cs.Magento-Store-View-Code', 'default'],
    ['8', 'commerce.headers.cs.Magento-Customer-group', 'd0b8ea36fca097dc92c02b1d104e6f41099184cb'],
    ['9', 'commerce.headers.cs.x-api-key', 'a6b4e2f69a4a4267a8f423c8caaf6a47'],
    ['3', 'commerce-root-category-id', '2'],
  ]}
/>

:::note
The default values listed above are all required.

Each `key` is described below with links to more details. The `value` for each key is specific to your Commerce instance and can be provided by your Commerce administrator.

All of the initializer blocks now automatically use any headers for the corresponding block if they are in the config. For example `commerce.headers.cart.Foo` will add a `Foo` header to graphql requests made by the cart dropin. This can be useful if you need to append certain headers for specific requests.

## Step-by-step

We'll use a mock PDP / Catalog Service block as an example of where and how to utilize the various config utilities and values.

<Tasks>

<Task>

### Import the getConfigValue function.

First, import the `getConfigValue` function from your boilerplate's `scripts/configs.js` file.

```javascript
import { getConfigValue } from '../../scripts/configs.js';
```

</Task>

<Task>

### Fetch and use some values.

Within the block's `decorate` function, use the `getConfigValue` function which takes a `string` that matches one of the keys from the `configs` file and returns the corresponding value.

```javascript

export default async function decorate(block) {
  // Get the catalog service endpoint
  const endpoint = await getConfigValue('commerce-endpoint');
  // get the catalog service required headers
  const headers = await getHeaders('cs');

  const response = await fetch(endpoint, { headers });

  // do stuff with response
}
```

</Task>

</Tasks>

## Summary

That's all it takes to connect a drop-in component Commerce block to your Commerce backend settings. You'll use the same configuration keys to connect any custom Commerce blocks or new Commerce blocks provided in later releases.
