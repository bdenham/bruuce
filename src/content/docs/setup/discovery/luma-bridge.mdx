This section provides guidance on how to implement the Luma Bridge for your Adobe Commerce on Edge Delivery Services project.

Before starting an implementation, clarify the following:

- Architecture of the cart, checkout, and account pages
- Complexity of the cart, checkout, and account pages
- Requirements for customization of the cart, checkout, and account pages

This information will help you decide whether to use Luma Bridge or a headless implementation for the cart, checkout, and account pages.

## What is Luma Bridge?

Luma Bridge is a session management mechanism between two storefronts:

- The main storefront (headless storefront) that is built using Commerce Boilerplate on Edge Delivery Services
- The default theme-based PHP storefront that is built using Adobe Commerce (Luma theme or another base theme)

It allows you to reuse complex parts of your storefront (e.g. cart, checkout, and account). This approach provides a path for Adobe customers currently using default theme based frontend to migrate to a highly performant shopping experience in a phased manner. Using Luma Bridge, you can progressively migrate your theme-based storefront to Edge Delivery Services.

If you already have a headless implementation for your storefront ([PWA Studio](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio), [Vue Storefront](https://vuestorefront.io/)), Luma Bridge is not a suitable solution to share session and other context between Edge Delivery Services and your storefront.

## Where can I get it?

Luma Bridge is currently on beta and will be made generally available in July 2025. Please reach out to your account manager if you would like to be part of the beta.

When using Luma Bridge, ensure that you have engineers on the project with backend PHP knowledge on Adobe Commerce.

## How do I implement it?

Luma bridge relies on Authentication Drop-in and Cart Drop-in based cookies generated by your Commerce Boilerplate based storefront on Edge Delivery Services.

These cookies include:
- A JWT token of customer session when user is logged-in, generated as a response of generateCustomerToken GraphQL mutation
- A Cart ID generated by Adobe Commerce GraphQL mutations that is technically a masked quote id

There are no changes needed on your Edge Delivery Services storefront if you are utilizing Authentication and Cart Drop-ins.

Luma Bridge is a PHP module installed on Adobe Commerce. Enabling the Luma Bridge on Adobe Commerce Admin configuration will allow Adobe Commerce recognize and create these cookies, in the same way your storefront drop-ins do. This way, any session generated on either of the applications will rely on same set of cookies, whether it is a guest or logged-in session.

### Requirements

- In order to enable cookie sharing between your Edge Delivery Services storefront and theme-based Adobe Commerce storefront, they need to share same top-level domain.
- Your storefront authentication and cart context needs to be managed via Authentication Drop-in and Cart Drop-in to ensure Luma Bridge is working with the correct set of cookies.
