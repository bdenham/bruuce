This section provides guidance on how to implement the Luma Bridge for your Adobe Commerce on Edge Delivery Services project.

Before starting an implementation, clarify the following:

- Architecture of the cart, checkout, and account pages
- Complexity of the cart, checkout, and account pages
- Requirements for customization of the cart, checkout, and account pages

This information will help you decide whether to use Luma Bridge or a headless implementation for the cart, checkout, and account pages.

## What is Luma Bridge?

Luma Bridge is a session management mechanism between two storefronts:

- The main storefront (headless storefront) that is built using the [Commerce boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce) on Edge Delivery Services
- The default, theme-based PHP storefront that is built using Adobe Commerce (Luma theme or another base theme)

It allows you to reuse complex parts of your storefront (for example, cart, checkout, and account). This approach provides a path for Adobe customers currently using default, theme-based storefronts to migrate to a highly performant shopping experience in a phased manner. Using Luma Bridge, you can progressively migrate your theme-based storefront to Edge Delivery Services.

The following demo site was built with Luma Bridge. You can access the full demo site at https://mcprod.eds.ecg.magento.com/.

:::note
If you already have a headless storefront implementation (for example, [PWA Studio](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio) or [Vue Storefront](https://vuestorefront.io/)), Luma Bridge is not a suitable solution to share session and other context between Edge Delivery Services and your storefront.

## Where can I get it?

Luma Bridge is currently available in beta and will be released for general availability in July 2025. Contact your account manager to participate in the beta program.

:::tip
When using Luma Bridge, ensure that you have engineers on the project with backend PHP knowledge on Adobe Commerce.

## How do I implement it?

Luma Bridge relies on cookies generated by the [user authentication](/dropins/user-auth/) and [cart](/dropins/cart/) drop-in components. These components are part of your Commerce boilerplate template-based storefront on Edge Delivery Services.

The cookies include:

- A JWT token that represents the customer session when the user is logged in, generated as a response to the `generateCustomerToken` GraphQL mutation.
- A cart ID that represents a masked quote ID, generated as a response of the `deleteMe` GraphQL mutation.

No changes are required on your Edge Delivery Services storefront when you use the user authentication and cart drop-in components.

Luma Bridge is a PHP module that you install in Adobe Commerce. When you enable Luma Bridge in the Adobe Commerce Admin configuration, Adobe Commerce can recognize and create the same cookies that your storefront drop-in components generate. This enables both applications to share the same session cookies, whether the user has a guest session or a logged-in session.

### Requirements

You must meet the following requirements to implement Luma Bridge:

- Both the Edge Delivery Services storefront and the theme-based Adobe Commerce storefront must operate on the same top-level domain.
- You must use the user authentication and cart drop-in components to manage your storefront authentication and cart context. This ensures that Luma Bridge works with the correct set of cookies.
