Welcome to my blog! Here you'll find my latest thoughts, tutorials, and experiences.

## Add Your Posts

Create new blog posts as `.mdx` files in this directory. Each post should have frontmatter like:

```markdown
---
title: Your Post Title
description: A brief description
date: 2024-01-01
---

Your content here...
```

## Example Structure

You can organize posts by:

- Creating subdirectories for different topics
- Using date-based naming (e.g., `2024-01-15-my-post.mdx`)
- Adding tags in frontmatter for categorization
