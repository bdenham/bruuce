Before starting any Adobe Commerce on Edge Delivery Services project, you must conduct a discovery phase to scope the project and ensure that there are no major roadblocks or risks.

## Big picture

In the [create your storefront](/get-started/) tutorial, you learned how to quickly create a new project based on the [Commerce boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce). The boilerplate provides a starter storefront that uses a pre-configured Adobe Commerce environment.

The next step is to plan, build, optimize, and launch a production-ready storefront connected to your own Adobe Commerce instance and storefront services. Here's an overview of the process:

</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. **Discovery**: Understand the requirements and goals of the project.
1. **Setup**: Configure the project environment and tools.
1. **Marketing and SEO**: Optimize the storefront for search engines and marketing campaigns.
1. **Launch**: Deploy the storefront to a production environment.

</Callouts>

The discovery phase is important because Adobe Commerce is a highly customizable platform with a large thid-party extension ecosystem. Migrating an Adobe Commerce storefront to Edge Delivery Services is similar to migrating to a headless storefront (like [PWA Studio](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio)).

:::note[Important]
The key requirement for a headless storefront implementation is that all required data is provided by APIs. Adobe Commerce provides all of the API coverage that you need for a successful implementation.

## Existing storefronts

If you have an existing Adobe Commerce storefront (Luma or PWA Studio), you can migrate it to Edge Delivery Services. The migration process involves identifying:

* **Third-party extensions**: Identify the third-party extensions that you are using in your storefront. For example, do you need to connect to third-party services?

* **Storefront components**: Identify the components that you want to migrate to Edge Delivery Services. For example, product detail, cart, checkout, and account pages.

* **Luma Bridge options**: If you are using the Luma theme, you can use the [Luma Bridge](/discovery/luma-bridge/) to migrate your existing Luma theme to Edge Delivery Services.

## Identify extensions

Before starting the project, use the following list to create an inventory of the Adobe Commerce extensions that are actively being used. This will help you understand which extensions can be replaced by out-of-the-box Adobe Commerce functionality.

* What extensions are currently in use?

* What type of data do the extensions provide (for example, reviews)?

* Is the data required on the frontend?
    
* How do the extensions expose the data (for example, GraphQL, REST API)?

* Do the extensions expose an API to access data (for example, [Amasty Labels](https://amasty.com/docs/doku.php?id=magento_2:product_labels))? If not, create an action item to expose the required data through an API. Options include:

  * Customize the Adobe Commerce Catalog Service exporter to export additional custom data to Catalog Service
  * Create a custom Adobe Commerce GraphQL query
  * Use [API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/graphql-mesh-gateway/)

* Are any of the extensions for delivery options (for example, shipping/BOPIS), payments, or tax providers? If you use third-party solutions, clarify if they expose APIs on the frontend and if they provide their own set of dropin components for the frontend integration.

## Validate option for dropins/widgets

Dropins are re-useable components that define the storefront shopping experience. They are framework agnostic and can be used in any context (Edge Delivery Services, AEM, Luma). However, this documentation focuses on the use of dropins in Edge Delivery Services projects using the [boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce). The dropin development roadmap is synchronised with Adobe Commerce APIs, so new API features are automatically available in dropins and widgets.

Storefront widgets in Adobe Commerce Live Search are tools that enhance the search functionality on your site. Widgets are designed to improve the user experience by making search results more accessible and relevant. There are two main types of widgets:

* **[Live Search Popover](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/live-search-storefront/storefront-popover)**: This widget appears as a box under the search field, displaying search results dynamically as users type their queries.
* **[Product Listing Page (PLP)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/live-search-storefront/plp-styling)**: This widget provides a searchable product listing page with facets and synonym support, making it easier for users to find products.

:::note
See the [dropins overview](/dropins/all/introduction/) for a list of all available dropins.

### Use cases and requirements

Document your use cases and requirements. If there are gaps, the Adobe team can help you understand how to fill them. For example:

* Identify if dropins can solve your use cases and requirements
* Identify what use cases are already supported, what is a gap, and what needs to be implemented differently from what is available out-of-the-box
* Reach out to the Adobe team early to share your use cases and get the recommendations about how to fulfill them: [commerce-storefront-compatibility@adobe.com](mailto:commerce-storefront-compatibility@adobe.com)

The Live Search Popover and PLP has two integration paths:

* Using the out-of-the-box hosted option where Adobe hosts the JavaScript file
  
    * Automatic updates for fixes and small features
    * Small upgrades available for major or breaking features
    * Can change some styling

* Using the customized option where Adobe provides a reference implementation for the components

    * Full control of customization and look and feel
    * You host the library and own the total cost of ownership
